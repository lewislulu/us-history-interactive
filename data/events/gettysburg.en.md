## Background
In the summer of 1863, General Lee led the Confederate army north into Pennsylvania, intending to achieve a decisive victory in the Northern heartland and force the Union to seek peace.

## Process
From July 1-3, the two armies fought a three-day bloody battle at Gettysburg. On the third day, Lee gambled everything, ordering Pickett to lead 12,500 men in a frontal assault on Union positions—this became the most heroic and most foolish attack of the Civil War.

## Result
Pickett's Charge ended in catastrophic defeat, with the Confederates suffering devastating losses. General Lee was forced to retreat back to Virginia. Gettysburg became the turning point of the Civil War; thereafter the Confederate army could no longer mount a northern offensive.

### Scene: Pickett's Charge
> General Lee (in anguish): "This is all my fault. All my fault."

As the gunsmoke cleared, thousands of bodies lay strewn across the field. Survivors crawled back to Confederate lines with difficulty. General Lee rode out to meet the retreating soldiers, tears streaming down his face.
