## Background
After the Civil War, a railroad connecting the East and West coasts became a national priority. The Central Pacific Railroad built eastward from the West, while the Union Pacific Railroad built westward from the East.

## Process
Tens of thousands of Chinese and Irish immigrant workers built the railroad under extreme conditions, crossing the Rocky Mountains and the Nevada desert.

## Result
On May 10, 1869, the two railroads met at Promontory Summit, Utah. A golden spike was driven into the final tie, completing the transcontinental railroad. The journey from New York to San Francisco was reduced from six months to one week.

### Scene: The Golden Spike
> Leland Stanford (proudly): "The transcontinental railroad is complete!"

Two locomotives faced each other on the tracks. Workers cheered and celebrated. A golden spike was driven into the last railroad tie, and telegraph transmitted this news instantly across the nation.
