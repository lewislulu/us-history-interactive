## Background
After the outbreak of World War I, the United States maintained neutrality. Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare and the Zimmermann Telegram outraged the United States.

## Process
In April 1917, President Wilson declared war on Congress, and the United States joined the Allied camp. Two million American troops rushed to Europe.

## Result
The entry of American forces reversed the situation on the Western Front. Germany surrendered in November 1918. After the war, Wilson proposed the "Fourteen Points" peace program and the concept of the League of Nations.
