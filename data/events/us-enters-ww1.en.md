## Background
After World War I broke out in 1914, President Wilson maintained a policy of neutrality, declaring that America would be "neutral in thought and deed." However, America's economic ties to the Allies grew increasingly strong, providing massive loans and munitions to Britain and France. In 1915, a German submarine sank the passenger liner Lusitania, killing 128 Americans and causing American outrage, but Wilson still held to peace. In early 1917, Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare, declaring it would sink any ship bound for Britain. Then Britain intercepted and decoded the Zimmermann Telegram, revealing Germany's attempt to entice Mexico to war against the U.S., promising to help Mexico recover Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. This became the final straw.

## Process
On April 2, 1917, President Wilson delivered a stirring war message to Congress: "The world must be made safe for democracy." He portrayed the war as a moral crusade, "the war to end all wars." Congress passed the war resolution by overwhelming margins, with only 6 senators (including progressive Robert La Follette) and 50 representatives voting against. America rapidly mobilized, using conscription to build an expeditionary force of 2 million men. Women entered factories en masse to support the war effort, accelerating the victory of the women's suffrage movement. Meanwhile, the Espionage Act and Sedition Act severely restricted civil liberties, with thousands of antiwar activists and socialists imprisoned.

## Result
The entry of American forces injected fresh vitality into the exhausted Allies, turning the tide on the Western Front. On November 11, 1918, Germany signed the armistice. After the war, Wilson proposed his idealistic "Fourteen Points" peace program, including the concept of establishing a League of Nations, but the Senate refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles, and America ultimately never joined the League. World War I temporarily ended America's isolationist tradition, but after the war America quickly retreated back into isolation. During the war, large numbers of African Americans migrated from the South to northern industrial cities for work, beginning the "Great Migration." The legacy of the Espionage and Sedition Acts warned of the dangers of restricting civil liberties during wartime.

**AP Note**: America's entry into WWI marked a temporary abandonment of traditional neutrality and isolationism. Unrestricted submarine warfare and the Zimmermann Telegram were direct triggers for intervention. The Espionage Act and Sedition Act passed during the war severely restricted freedom of speech and civil liberties. Women's contributions to the war effort accelerated passage of the 19th Amendment (women's suffrage). The war triggered the "Great Migration" of African Americans, transforming America's demographic and racial landscape.

### Scene: Making the World Safe for Democracy

> Woodrow Wilson (solemnly): "We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities, no material compensation. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. The world must be made safe for democracy!"

Late on the night of April 2, 1917, the congressional chamber was packed, the atmosphere tense. President Wilson stood at the podium, once a committed pacifist, now forced to ask Congress to declare war. His voice was filled with moral conviction and idealistic passion, portraying this war as a crusade to save civilization. Most congressmen rose to cheer, but a few remained silent.

> Robert La Follette (bitterly): "I vote no. Sending our young men to die for Europe's imperialist wars is not democracy—it is a betrayal of Washington's warning!"
