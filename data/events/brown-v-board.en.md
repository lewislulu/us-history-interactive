## Background
Under the "separate but equal" doctrine established in Plessy v. Ferguson, seventeen Southern states and Washington D.C. enforced mandatory racial segregation in public schools. Black schools had tattered textbooks, overcrowded classrooms, and facilities far inferior to white schools. NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall (who would later become the first Black Supreme Court Justice) represented Linda Brown and other families from Topeka, Kansas in filing suit.

## Process
Marshall's defense strategy challenged not only unequal facilities but argued from a psychological perspective that segregation itself was inherently unequal. He cited the "doll experiment" by psychologists Kenneth and Mamie Clark—Black children tended to prefer white dolls and consider Black dolls "bad," proving that racial segregation inflicted profound psychological harm and feelings of inferiority on Black children. Chief Justice Earl Warren spent months persuading all nine justices to reach unanimity.

## Result
On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously (9-0) that racial segregation in public schools violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. "Separate but equal" was officially overturned in education. Warren wrote in the opinion: "In the field of public education, the doctrine of 'separate but equal' has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal." However, the ruling set no timeline for implementation, and Southern states launched "massive resistance"—true desegregation would take decades.

**AP Focus**: The most frequently tested Supreme Court case in APUSH. Must know: 1) Overturned Plessy v. Ferguson; 2) Based on 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause; 3) Psychological evidence from "doll experiment"; 4) Significance of 9-0 unanimous decision; 5) Context of Southern "massive resistance" after the ruling.

### Scene: Unanimous Reversal
> Chief Justice Warren (gravely): "In the field of public education, the doctrine of 'separate but equal' has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal."

The courtroom fell silent. Reporters scribbled frantically. Thurgood Marshall bowed his head, his shoulders trembling slightly. In Topeka, Kansas, nine-year-old Linda Brown didn't fully understand what had happened—but she knew that next fall, she could attend the school nearest her home.
