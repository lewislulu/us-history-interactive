## Background
In 1823, European powers were attempting to reassert control over Latin America's former colonies following the Napoleonic Wars. The Spanish Empire had collapsed, and newly independent Latin American nations faced the threat of European intervention. The United States feared that European powers would reestablish colonial rule in the Western Hemisphere, threatening both emerging American interests and republican ideals.

## Process
On December 2, 1823, President Monroe delivered a bold foreign policy declaration in his annual message to Congress. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams was the principal architect of this policy. Monroe declared that the Western Hemisphere was no longer open to European colonization, and that any European attempt to interfere in American affairs would be viewed as a hostile act toward the United States. In exchange, America promised not to interfere with existing European colonies or European internal affairs.

## Result
The Monroe Doctrine became a cornerstone of American foreign policy, influencing it for two centuries. Though the United States initially lacked the naval power to enforce this declaration, it established the principle of American dominance in the Western Hemisphere. This policy was invoked numerous times throughout history, from blocking European intervention to justifying America's own interventionist policies. It represented America's transition from isolationism to regional hegemony.

**AP Note**: The Monroe Doctrine, drafted primarily by Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, was a unilateral declaration of American foreign policy. It established principles of anti-colonialism and US hemispheric dominance, and though initially lacking enforcement capability, became a guiding principle of American diplomacy for 200 years.

### Scene: Address to Congress

> President Monroe (firmly): "We solemnly declare to the European powers—the continents of America are no longer subjects for your colonial expansion. Any attempt to extend your political system to our hemisphere, we shall consider dangerous to our peace and safety."

The congressional chamber fell silent. This aging president was announcing a policy that would reshape the world order, though America's naval power was not yet sufficient to enforce such a declaration.

> Secretary of State Adams (confidently): "We seek no interference in European affairs, but the future of the Western Hemisphere belongs to free republics, not monarchical colonies. This is the New World's declaration to the Old."

> Congressman (worried): "But do we have the power to back such a declaration? The British fleet far surpasses ours."

> Adams (calmly): "Power comes not only from cannons, but from principles. The seeds we plant today will bear fruit for a century to come. America's destiny lies on this continent, not in the courts of Europe."
