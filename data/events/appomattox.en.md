## Background
By early April 1865, Confederate defeat was inevitable. General Grant's Union forces had captured Richmond, and General Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, weakened by continuous battles and retreat, was reduced to about 28,000 hungry, ragged soldiers. Lee attempted to retreat south to join General Joseph Johnston's army, but Union cavalry cut off his escape route. Surrounded and without supplies, Lee faced the choice of either surrendering or seeing his army annihilated in a desperate breakout attempt.

## Process
On April 9, 1865, General Lee, dressed in full military dress uniform with a ceremonial sword, went to the home of Wilmer McLean in Appomattox Court House, Virginia. General Grant arrived in a muddy field uniform, without a sword. The two generals met in the parlor, the atmosphere solemn but respectful. Grant offered generous terms: Confederate officers could keep their sidearms, all soldiers could keep their horses for spring plowing, and could go home provided they pledged not to fight against the United States again. There would be no treason trials, no executions.

## Result
The Appomattox surrender effectively ended the American Civil War, though other Confederate armies surrendered over the following weeks. Grant's generous terms set the tone for reconciliation—his famous words "Let us have peace" embodied Lincoln's desire "with malice toward none, with charity for all." However, this spirit of generosity did not last through Reconstruction. Lincoln's assassination five days later was followed by Radical Reconstruction that contrasted sharply with the reconciliation spirit of Appomattox. Nevertheless, the conduct of Grant and Lee on that spring day prevented guerrilla warfare and allowed the nation to begin healing.

**AP Note**: Appomattox effectively ended the Civil War. Grant's generous terms aimed at reconciliation: "Let us have peace." Allowed keeping of horses and sidearms, no treason trials. Contrasts with the harshness of later Reconstruction period.

### Scene: Surrender Meeting

In the parlor of the McLean house, two of the greatest generals in American history sat facing each other. The contrast was stark—Lee in an immaculate gray uniform, Grant in a muddy blue field coat.

> Grant (respectfully): "General Lee, we met during the Mexican War. I am honored to see you again, though under such circumstances."

> Lee (with dignity): "Yes, I remember you, General Grant. Time has changed us all. I have come to learn what terms you propose for the surrender."

> Grant (directly): "The terms are simple. Your men must lay down their arms and pledge not to fight again. But officers may keep their sidearms. Any man who claims to own a horse or mule may take it with him—they'll need them for spring plowing."

A flash of surprise crossed Lee's eyes. This was far more generous than he had expected.

> Lee (moved): "This will have a very happy effect on my army and will do much toward reconciliation. I thank you, sir, on behalf of my men."

> Grant: "We've been fighting for four years. It's time for peace. These men are Americans, and they'll soon be American citizens again. I want them to go home and start rebuilding their lives."

> Lee (sadly but with dignity): "My men have been without rations for four days. They are starving."

> Grant (immediately): "How many rations do you need? I'll order my commissary to issue them. Will 25,000 be enough?"

> Lee: "Ample and generous, sir."

The two generals signed the surrender documents. When Lee walked out of the house, Grant and all Union officers rose and saluted. Lee returned the salute, mounted his war horse Traveller, and rode away for the last time.

> Lee (to his aide): "The war is over. We have done all we could. Now we must accept the results and be good citizens."

On the hill, when Lee's soldiers saw him return, they realized what had happened. Many wept, but none blamed their general.

> Confederate Soldier (choking): "General, we can still fight! We can take to the hills and fight guerrilla style!"

> Lee (firmly): "No. We have fought our fight. To continue would only bring more bloodshed. Go home, boys. Go back to your families and help rebuild our land. The war is over."
