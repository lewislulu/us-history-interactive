## Background
In April 1775, tensions in Massachusetts Colony reached a breaking point. British General Thomas Gage learned that patriots were stockpiling weapons and ammunition in Concord and dispatched 700 troops to seize them. Paul Revere and William Dawes rode through the night warning the countryside: "The British are coming!" Militia companies known as "Minutemen" rapidly assembled, preparing to meet the redcoats at Lexington Green. This was the explosion point of a decade of colonial resistance—from protests against the Stamp Act to the defiance of the Boston Tea Party, conflict finally escalated from words to weapons.

## Process
At dawn on April 19, approximately 70 militiamen formed a line on Lexington Green, facing several times their number in British regulars. British Major John Pitcairn ordered the militia to disperse, and during the tense standoff, a shot suddenly rang out—history will never determine who fired first. British volleys followed immediately, killing eight militiamen on the spot. The British column continued toward Concord but encountered fierce resistance from hundreds of militiamen at Concord's North Bridge. During the long march back to Boston, militia fighters hidden behind trees and stone walls continuously sniped at the retreating British, inflicting heavy casualties in a running battle.

## Result
The Battles of Lexington and Concord marked the official beginning of the American Revolutionary War. British losses totaled 273 men, colonial militia 93, but more importantly, this victory proved that militia could stand against the world's most powerful army. News spread throughout the thirteen colonies, igniting widespread anti-British sentiment. Two months later, the Second Continental Congress appointed George Washington as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. This battle became known as "the shot heard round the world" because it not only launched the American Revolution but also inspired resistance to monarchical tyranny across the globe.

**AP Note**: This was the first military engagement of the Revolutionary War, marking the colonies' transition from political protest to armed revolution. AP exams emphasize the unique Minutemen militia system, the significance of colonial guerrilla tactics against regular forces, and how this event pushed moderates toward independence. The battle demonstrated both colonial military readiness and political resolve.

### Scene: The Shot Heard Round the World

Morning mist shrouded Lexington Green as 70 militiamen formed ranks under Captain John Parker. In the distance, the rhythmic tramp of boots echoed as 700 redcoats emerged from the fog, bayonets glinting in the pale light.

> Captain John Parker (steady and calm): "Don't fire unless fired upon, but if they mean to have a war, let it begin here."

The militiamen gripped their muskets, palms sweating. Many were farmers and craftsmen who had never seen real combat. British Major Pitcairn rode forward, waving his saber.

> Major Pitcairn (shouting arrogantly): "Lay down your arms, you damned rebels! Disperse!"

Tense silence. Suddenly, a single shot cracked through the dawn—no one knows who pulled the trigger. In an instant, British volleys erupted in flashes of fire and smoke that engulfed the green. When the smoke cleared, eight militiamen lay in pools of blood, the first blood of the Revolutionary War spilled on Massachusetts soil. That shot truly did echo around the world.
