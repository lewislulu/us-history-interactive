## Background
After the 1954 Brown v. Board decision, Southern states launched a "Massive Resistance" movement, refusing to enforce the ruling to desegregate schools. Little Rock Central High School in Arkansas planned to admit nine Black students in the fall of 1957—a moderate integration plan for the city. However, Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus, seeking to please segregationist voters, deployed the National Guard to prevent the Black students from entering the school.

## Process
On September 4, 1957, fifteen-year-old Elizabeth Eckford walked alone toward the school entrance. She had not received the notice to meet as a group (her family had no telephone) and faced the fury of a white mob alone—they spat at her and hurled insults. National Guard soldiers blocked her path. The photograph circulated around the world, becoming one of the most shocking images of racial hatred.

President Eisenhower—though he was personally unenthusiastic about the Brown decision—had no choice. He deployed 1,000 paratroopers from the 101st Airborne Division to escort the nine Black students into the school. This was the first time since Reconstruction that federal troops had enforced civil rights laws in the South.

## Result
The "Little Rock Nine" completed one school year under the protection of federal soldiers—being shoved in hallways, having food thrown at them in the cafeteria, receiving death threats daily. Governor Faubus closed all Little Rock public high schools for a year the following year. The Little Rock crisis demonstrated that without federal enforcement, the Supreme Court's ruling was merely words on paper. It also became a propaganda disaster during the Cold War—Soviet media extensively covered American racial discrimination.

**AP Focus**: Little Rock is the most important enforcement case following the Brown v. Board decision. Essential topics: 1) Federal power vs. state power; 2) Constitutional basis for Eisenhower's use of military force; 3) The "Massive Resistance" movement; 4) International impact of racial issues in the Cold War context.

### Scene: The Nine Black Students
> Elizabeth Eckford (recalling): "I tried to find a friendly face in the crowd, but there was none. I saw a white woman and thought she would help me, but she spat in my face."

The fifteen-year-old girl wore a carefully ironed checkered dress, clutching her textbooks as she walked toward the school. Behind her was a mob of hundreds. Behind her sunglasses were tears of fear, but her steps did not falter. A Black girl walking toward a white school—this photograph defined an era.
