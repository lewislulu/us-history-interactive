## Background
In January 1973, the United States and North Vietnam signed the Paris Peace Accords, and American troops officially withdrew from Vietnam. However, this was merely a "decent interval" allowing the US to exit a war that had lasted over a decade and killed 58,000 Americans and millions of Vietnamese. President Nixon had promised the South Vietnamese government that America would re-intervene if North Vietnam violated the ceasefire. But after Nixon's resignation due to Watergate in 1974, Congress refused to continue military aid to South Vietnam. By early 1975, North Vietnamese forces launched a full-scale offensive, and South Vietnamese troops retreated in disarray with collapsing morale. America could only watch helplessly as its ally faced annihilation, powerless and unwilling to intervene again.

## Process
In April 1975, North Vietnamese forces advanced southward at astonishing speed, capturing major cities one after another. On April 21, South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu resigned and fled the country, condemning America for abandoning its ally. On April 29, North Vietnamese artillery hit Tan Son Nhut Air Base, triggering Operation Frequent Wind, the final US evacuation. Helicopters shuttled over Saigon, evacuating American personnel and some South Vietnamese refugees from the US Embassy and other locations. Thousands of desperate Vietnamese surged toward the embassy, trying to scale the walls, begging to board the helicopters. Many Vietnamese who had worked for the Americans were left behind, facing an uncertain fate. On the morning of April 30, the last helicopter lifted off from the embassy roof. Hours later, North Vietnamese tanks crashed through the gates of the Presidential Palace, and South Vietnam surrendered unconditionally.

## Result
The fall of Saigon marked the end of the Vietnam War and America's first major military defeat. The war cost the US over $140 billion, killed 58,000 American servicemen, wounded hundreds of thousands more, and caused millions of Vietnamese civilian casualties. The war created deep divisions in American society, sparking the anti-war movement and widespread distrust of government. In 1973, Congress passed the War Powers Act, limiting the president's ability to deploy troops without congressional authorization. "Vietnam Syndrome" influenced American foreign policy for decades, making the US more cautious about overseas military intervention. After Vietnam's unification, hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese became "boat people" fleeing communist rule. The war's scars—from veterans' PTSD to health problems from Agent Orange—continued to affect people in both nations.

**AP Note**: The fall of Saigon symbolized the failure of America's Cold War containment policy, shattering the myth of American military invincibility. It widened the "credibility gap," deepening public skepticism of government statements. The War Powers Act represented Congress's attempt to rebalance executive power. The memory of Vietnam shaped American attitudes toward subsequent military interventions, visible from the Reagan era through the Gulf War.

### Scene: Embassy Evacuation

> US Marine (shouting at Vietnamese crowded outside embassy gates): "We have no more room! Please step back!"

Afternoon of April 29, 1975—the American Embassy in Saigon had become a scene of desperation. Helicopters constantly landed and took off from the rooftop, their rotors deafening. Thousands of Vietnamese gathered outside the high embassy walls—some had worked for the US government, some were military families, all knew the North Vietnamese army would arrive soon.

> Nguyen Van Minh, Vietnamese translator (gripping the iron gate, pleading to American officials inside): "Please! I worked for the CIA for ten years! If the communists catch me, they'll kill me! My wife, my children!"

> US diplomat (shaking his head painfully): "I'm so sorry. We truly have no more room. The manifest is full."

Some desperate Vietnamese tried to scale the 14-foot walls. Marines had to push them down, though it pained them internally. Inside the embassy, American personnel were burning classified documents, smoke billowing from windows.

> US Ambassador Graham Martin (to his deputy): "We promised to protect these people. This is America's shame."

On the roof, CH-46 and CH-53 helicopters landed every 10 minutes, each time carrying away a small group. Pilots were exhausted but kept flying. The crowd below grew more desperate, knowing time was running out. By late night, hundreds still waited, but the order came: the last few helicopters would take only Americans.

At dawn, the final helicopter lifted off, leaving over 400 Vietnamese in the embassy courtyard. They looked up at the lights disappearing into darkness, realizing they had been abandoned. The "Free Vietnam" America had fought for twenty years would cease to exist in hours.

### Scene: Tanks at the Presidential Palace

> North Vietnamese tank commander (over radio): "All units, advance! Target: Independence Palace!"

10:45 AM, April 30, 1975—Saigon's streets were eerily silent. Most citizens hid in their homes, waiting for the inevitable. South Vietnamese soldiers shed their uniforms, trying to blend in as civilians. T-54 and T-59 tanks rumbled through empty streets toward the Presidential Palace—symbol of the South Vietnamese regime.

Inside Independence Palace, newly appointed South Vietnamese President Duong Van Minh and his cabinet sat in the conference room, listening to the sound of distant artillery growing closer. They knew it was over.

> Duong Van Minh (to his generals): "Do we have any troops willing to fight?"

> General (shaking his head): "None, Mr. President. The army has disintegrated."

At 11:30, North Vietnamese tank number 843 crashed through the palace's iron gates and entered the courtyard. Soldiers jumped off tanks, charging into the building with AK-47s. They ran up stairs and burst into the conference room.

> North Vietnamese officer (to Duong Van Minh): "Are you the president?"

> Duong Van Minh (calmly): "Yes, I have been waiting to transfer power peacefully."

> North Vietnamese officer: "You have nothing to transfer. You and your regime have surrendered unconditionally."

A North Vietnamese soldier climbed to the roof, tore down South Vietnam's yellow flag with three red stripes, and raised North Vietnam's red flag with a gold star. Outside the building, more tanks and military vehicles poured into the city. Soldiers occupied radio stations, police stations, military bases.

At noon, Saigon Radio broadcast Duong Van Minh's surrender statement, but the voice was now a North Vietnamese announcer: "The South Vietnamese regime has surrendered. Saigon is now Ho Chi Minh City. The war is over."

In the streets, some wept, some cheered, most simply watched numbly. Twenty years of war, millions of deaths, ending this way. America's longest war was over, but the scars would last for generations. For the South Vietnamese left behind, a new and darker chapter was just beginning.
