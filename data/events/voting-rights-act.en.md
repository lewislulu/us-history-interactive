## Background
Although the 15th Amendment (1870) guaranteed Black voting rights, Southern states systematically disenfranchised Black citizens through literacy tests, poll taxes, "grandfather clauses," and violent intimidation. In Mississippi, while Black people comprised 45% of the population, only 6.7% of Black citizens were registered to vote. The 1964 Civil Rights Act failed to effectively address voting rights issues. Martin Luther King Jr. decided to launch a voting rights campaign in Selma, Alabama.

## Process
On March 7, 1965, "Bloody Sunday"—approximately 600 marchers departed from Selma, planning to walk to Montgomery to petition. On the Edmund Pettus Bridge, Alabama state troopers violently dispersed the marchers with tear gas and nightsticks. The television footage shocked the nation—police beating unarmed Black women and elderly people. Two days later, a white minister participating in a solidarity march was beaten to death by racists.

President Johnson delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress, invoking the civil rights movement's slogan: "We Shall Overcome." This was the first time an American president used this slogan from the Black civil rights movement.

## Result
On August 6, 1965, Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act. The legislation banned discriminatory voting restrictions like literacy tests and authorized federal examiners to monitor voter registration in the South. The effects were immediate: Black voter registration in Mississippi surged from 6.7% to 59.8%. This was the most powerful voting rights protection from the federal government since Reconstruction, fundamentally transforming the Southern political landscape.

### Scene: Bloody Sunday
> John Lewis (injured but resolute): "I saw death coming toward me, but I'm not going to back down."

Twenty-five-year-old John Lewis walked at the front of the column. When the troopers charged, he knelt down and began to pray. A nightstick shattered his skull. He later recalled: "I thought I was going to die." But he did not fight back. The television footage aired on the evening news. The next day, tens of thousands across the nation poured into the streets—white people, Black people, students, ministers. After watching the news at the White House, Johnson told his aide, "Get me the voting rights bill. I'm sending it to Congress."
