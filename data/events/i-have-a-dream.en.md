### Scene: Before the Lincoln Memorial
> Martin Luther King Jr. (passionate): "I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."

Two hundred and fifty thousand people gathered along both sides of the Reflecting Pool before the Washington Monument. Dr. King's voice carried through loudspeakers across the plaza, and in the crowd—people of all colors—many wept.
