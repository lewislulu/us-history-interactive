## Background
In the 1920s, America experienced the unprecedented prosperity of the "Roaring Twenties." Stock market speculation flourished, and the bubble grew larger and larger.

## Process
On October 29, 1929—"Black Tuesday"—the Wall Street stock market crashed. Banks failed, factories closed, and unemployment soared to 25%.

## Result
The Great Depression lasted ten years and was the most severe economic crisis in the capitalist world. In 1933, Roosevelt took office and implemented the New Deal, saving the American economy through measures like Social Security and financial regulation.

### Scene: Black Tuesday
> Wall Street Trader (in despair): "It's all over... Everyone is selling!"

Chaos reigned on the trading floor. Stock prices plummeted like a waterfall, ticker tape spewing from machines, piling thick on the floor. People wept in the streets.
