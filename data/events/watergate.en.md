## Background
1972 was Nixon's reelection year. He had achieved remarkable diplomatic successes—visiting China, detente with the Soviet Union—and led in the polls by wide margins. But paranoia and distrust pervaded the White House. Nixon established the "Plumbers," a secret unit dedicated to suppressing political enemies and plugging intelligence leaks.

## Process
In the early morning of June 17, 1972, five men were arrested at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C., while installing wiretapping equipment. This appeared to be a minor incident, but two Washington Post reporters—Woodward and Bernstein—traced the discovery that the burglars were directly connected to Nixon's reelection campaign. More importantly, the White House attempted a cover-up—using the CIA to obstruct the FBI investigation, destroying evidence, and bribing witnesses.

Senate hearings revealed that the White House had installed a recording system. Nixon refused to turn over the tapes, and ultimately the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in "United States v. Nixon" that the President must surrender the recordings. The tapes confirmed that Nixon had participated in the cover-up just six days after the break-in.

## Result
On August 9, 1974, facing certain impeachment, Nixon became the only president in American history to resign. Vice President Ford succeeded him and pardoned Nixon. Watergate's impact far exceeded the fall of one president: it profoundly shook Americans' trust in government, spawned legislation limiting executive power such as the War Powers Act and the Freedom of Information Act, and "-gate" became the suffix for all political scandals.

**AP Focus**: Watergate is one of the most frequently tested events in modern APUSH history. Essential topics: 1) How separation of powers in the Constitution operated (Congressional investigation, Supreme Court ruling, presidential resignation); 2) The limits of "executive privilege"; 3) Long-term impact on public trust; 4) The media's oversight role; 5) Connection to the concept of the "Imperial Presidency."

### Scene: I Am Not A Crook
> Nixon (angrily): "People have got to know whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I'm not a crook."

At the November 1973 press conference, sweat beaded on Nixon's forehead. The reporters' questions grew increasingly pointed. One year later, when he walked out of the White House for the last time and boarded the helicopter, he turned around and raised both hands in his signature V-sign. The door closed. America's 37th President disappeared into the Washington sky.
