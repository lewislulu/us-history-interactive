## Background
In 1830, President Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, requiring Eastern Indian tribes to relocate west of the Mississippi River to "Indian Territory."

## Process
From 1838-1839, approximately 15,000 Cherokee were forcibly removed, marching 1,600 kilometers on foot. In the bitter winter, they lacked adequate clothing and food, and disease was rampant.

## Result
About 4,000 Cherokee died en route, one-quarter of the total population. The "Trail of Tears" became one of the darkest chapters in American history.

### Scene: The Cherokee March
> Cherokee Chief John Ross (grieving): "This land is the home of our ancestors, every tree remembers our history."

In the bitter wind, elders, women, and children trudged forward with heavy steps. Behind them lay the homeland where they had lived for generations; ahead lay an unknown wilderness.
