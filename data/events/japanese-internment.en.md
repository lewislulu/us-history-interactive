## Background
On December 7, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, and the United States immediately declared war on Japan. In an atmosphere of war panic and surging anti-Japanese sentiment, the Japanese American community on the West Coast became targets of suspicion and hostility. Although two-thirds were American-born citizens (Nisei), their Japanese ancestry made them viewed as potential spies and saboteurs. Newspapers fueled fear, politicians demanded action, and the military worried about a possible Japanese invasion of the West Coast. On February 19, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, authorizing the military to designate "military areas" on the West Coast and remove anyone deemed a threat from these regions. Though the order didn't explicitly mention Japanese Americans, it was applied almost exclusively to them.

## Process
Within weeks of the order, approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans—including the elderly, women, and children—were forcibly removed from their homes. They had 48 hours or less to dispose of property, carrying only what they could hold. Families were forced to sell or abandon homes, farms, and businesses, usually receiving pittance prices. They were first sent to temporary "assembly centers"—often converted racetracks or fairgrounds where people lived in horse stables. Then they were transferred to ten permanent "relocation centers" (the government avoided the term "concentration camps"), located in remote desert or wilderness areas of California, Arizona, Utah, Wyoming, and other states. These camps were surrounded by barbed wire, with armed guards and watchtowers, harsh conditions—scorching summers, freezing winters, no privacy, crude facilities.

## Result
Japanese Americans spent most of the war in camps until late 1944 to 1945 when they were allowed to return. Many lost all property and livelihoods, returning to hostile communities. Ironically, about 30,000 Nisei youth enlisted or volunteered for the U.S. military from camps, including the famous 442nd Infantry Regiment—composed entirely of Japanese Americans, becoming one of the most decorated units in U.S. history, fighting heroically in Europe. In 1944, the Supreme Court in Korematsu v. United States ruled 6-3 that the detention policy was constitutional, judges citing wartime "pressing military necessity." Not until 1988 did President Reagan sign the Civil Liberties Act, formally apologizing to internees and providing $20,000 compensation each. This event became one of the most serious civil liberties violations in American history, demonstrating how wartime fear and racial prejudice can override constitutional rights.

**AP Note**: Executive Order 9066 led to 120,000 Japanese Americans (two-thirds citizens) being imprisoned without trial. Korematsu v. United States (1944) upheld internment but was later widely criticized. The government officially apologized in 1988 and provided compensation (Civil Liberties Act). This event raised debates about wartime civil liberties vs. national security, showing how racial prejudice and war panic led to severe constitutional rights violations. The 442nd Infantry Regiment's heroic service highlighted this injustice.

### Scene: 48 Hours to Say Goodbye

March 1942, a Japanese American farm outside San Jose, California. Three generations of the Tanaka family stood before the strawberry farm they had built over twenty years. A military notice was posted on the wall: "All persons of Japanese ancestry must report to assembly centers within 48 hours. Only what you can carry."

> Mr. Tanaka (Issei, angry and desperate): "I've worked this land for twenty years! My sons were born here, they're American citizens! Why are we being treated as enemies?"

> Mrs. Tanaka (sadly packing): "Do we have a choice? The notice says we'll be arrested if we don't comply. Our neighbors... they won't even look us in the eye."

Their 17-year-old son Kenji held a small suitcase containing a few clothes and a family photo. He looked out at the strawberry fields—spring shoots just emerging.

> Kenji (bitterly): "Dad, we're Americans! I go to school here, my friends are here! Why are we being locked up while German and Italian Americans aren't?"

> Mr. Tanaka (painfully): "Because of our faces, son. Because we look like the enemy."

Outside the door, a white neighbor approached, handing them an envelope.

> Neighbor (awkwardly, sympathetically): "Mr. Tanaka, I... I'm sorry. This is what I can offer for your farm. I know it's far from enough, but..."

> Mr. Tanaka (taking the envelope, hands trembling): "This farm is worth ten thousand dollars. You're giving me five hundred. But I have no time to bargain, do I? Tomorrow we leave."

The next day, the Tanaka family and hundreds of other Japanese families lined up at the assembly center—a converted racetrack. Families were assigned to horse stables, the smell of hay still lingering. Weeks later, they were loaded onto trains, curtains drawn so they couldn't see where they were going. The train stopped in the desert, and they were brought to a camp surrounded by barbed wire—the Gila River War Relocation Center in Arizona. Guards in watchtowers held guns, muzzles pointed inward.

> Kenji (whispering to his father): "The watchtower guns point at us, not outward. They're not protecting us, they're guarding us."

> Mr. Tanaka (wearily): "Now you understand, son. We're not being protected—we're prisoners. In our own country, we're prisoners."

Three years later, when the war ended and they were released, the Tanaka family returned to San Jose to find their farm abandoned, their house looted. But the most painful was the community's indifference and hostility. Kenji later volunteered for the 442nd Infantry Regiment—a unit composed entirely of Japanese Americans—fighting in Europe to prove their loyalty, earning a Purple Heart. Half a century later, he testified to Congress: "We lost everything, but we never lost faith in being American. That made our imprisonment more cruel, and more wrong."
