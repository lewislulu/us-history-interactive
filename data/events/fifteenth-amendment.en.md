## Background
The 13th Amendment abolished slavery and the 14th granted citizenship, but neither explicitly guaranteed voting rights for Black men. During Reconstruction, Southern states under federal military supervision were required to grant Black suffrage, but many Northern states still restricted Black voting. Radical Republicans realized that without constitutional protection, Black political rights could be stripped away once federal troops left the South. Republicans also had political motivation—Black voters tended to support the Republican Party that had given them freedom.

## Process
In 1869, Congress passed the 15th Amendment, prohibiting federal or state governments from denying citizens the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude. The amendment passed amid fierce debate—some abolitionists criticized it for not including women's suffrage, while some conservatives opposed federal interference in state voting rights. On February 3, 1870, the amendment received the required three-fourths state ratification. President Grant called it "a victory for civilization," and Black communities nationwide held massive celebrations.

## Result
The 15th Amendment represented the climax of Reconstruction, completing the trilogy of Reconstruction Amendments. In its first years, it did enable thousands of Black men to vote, and many Blacks were elected to local, state, and federal offices. However, as Reconstruction ended, Southern states developed sophisticated methods to circumvent the amendment—literacy tests, poll taxes, grandfather clauses, white primaries, and violent intimidation (KKK). These tactics effectively disenfranchised most Southern Blacks until the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 finally enforced it.

**AP Note**: The 15th Amendment prohibited denying the vote based on race. Third Reconstruction Amendment. Southern states later circumvented it with literacy tests, poll taxes, grandfather clauses. Not truly enforced until the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

### Scene: Celebration and Warning

In March 1870, Washington DC held a grand parade celebrating ratification of the 15th Amendment. Thousands of Black citizens flooded the streets, waving flags and singing freedom songs.

> Black Voter (excitedly): "We finally got it! The vote! My father was born a slave, and I will vote as a citizen!"

> Young Black Man (proudly): "We are full Americans now. We can choose our leaders, shape our future!"

Among the celebrating crowd, Frederick Douglass stood at a podium. This former slave was now the nation's most influential Black leader. His speech began with joy but quickly turned to warning.

> Douglass (gravely): "Friends, today we celebrate a great victory. The 15th Amendment is a milestone in our journey to freedom. But let me warn you—rights on paper and rights in hand are two different things."

The crowd quieted, listening carefully.

> Douglass (continuing): "The enemies of freedom in the South will not surrender easily. They will find ways—clever, hidden ways—to deny us this constitutional right. Literacy tests, poll taxes, intimidation, violence. The Constitution may say we have the vote, but without federal enforcement, without our eternal vigilance, these rights will be mere words on parchment."

> White Ally (optimistically): "But Mr. Douglass, President Grant has pledged to protect Black rights. Federal troops are in the South. The law is on our side."

> Douglass (shaking his head): "Troops will not stay forever. Political winds will shift. Those who protect us today may bargain away our rights tomorrow for political power. History teaches us that justice is not won once and for all—it must be fought for every day, every generation."

> President Grant (nearby, firmly): "Mr. Douglass is right to counsel vigilance. But today, let us also celebrate. Five years ago, these men were slaves. Today, they are voters. This is real progress."

> Douglass (to Grant): "Indeed, Mr. President. We have come far. But the road ahead may be harder than the road behind. This amendment is a promise. Now we must ensure America keeps that promise—not just today, but a century from now."

> Elderly Black Woman (in the crowd): "My sons can vote now, but I cannot. They say women cannot vote. When will it be our time?"

> Susan B. Anthony (suffragist, bitterly): "They chose race over sex. Black men got the vote before white women. But we will not stop fighting. Our time will come."

Douglass looked at the celebrating crowd, but worry was in his eyes. He knew the arc of history was long, and victories were often fleeting. The next century would prove his concerns justified.
