## Background
Though Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation (1863) freed slaves in rebellious Southern states, it was only a wartime executive order with weak legal foundation. It did not apply to loyal border slave states (Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware) or Union-controlled Southern territories. Lincoln worried that post-war courts might overturn the proclamation and slavery would be restored in the South. The only permanent solution was a constitutional amendment. In 1864, the amendment passed the Senate but failed to achieve the required two-thirds majority in the House. Lincoln made passage of the amendment his top priority.

## Process
On January 31, 1865, under Lincoln's intense lobbying, the House voted again on the 13th Amendment. The president used every strategy—promising appointments, applying political pressure, appealing to moral conscience. The debate was fierce. Some Democrats argued the amendment exceeded federal power; abolitionists argued it was the only way to fulfill America's founding promise. As the roll call proceeded, the chamber was silent. The final vote was 119 in favor, 56 against—just two votes more than the required two-thirds majority. The House erupted in thunderous applause and cheers, with people in the gallery weeping and embracing.

## Result
The 13th Amendment was officially ratified on December 6, 1865, permanently abolishing slavery and involuntary servitude throughout the United States (except as punishment for crime). It was the first of three Reconstruction Amendments (13th, 14th, 15th) that fundamentally transformed the US Constitution and society. It achieved the core goal the North had fought for in the Civil War and made restoration of slavery legally impossible. However, the "except as punishment for crime" exception clause was later exploited by Southern states to exploit African American labor through convict leasing systems and mass incarceration.

**AP Note**: The 13th Amendment constitutionally abolished slavery everywhere (the Emancipation Proclamation was limited to rebel states). First of three Reconstruction Amendments (13th, 14th, 15th). Required Lincoln's intense lobbying to pass. "Except as punishment for crime" exception later exploited.

### Scene: House Vote

The House chamber was packed—congressmen, journalists, spectators all witnessing a historic moment. Lincoln sat in the gallery, his face tense.

> Speaker (solemnly): "The question is whether the House shall, by a two-thirds majority, pass the joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution abolishing slavery. The clerk will call the roll."

Silence enveloped the chamber. Every vote counted.

> Clerk: "Mr. Alley?"

> Congressman Alley: "Aye."

> Clerk: "Mr. Baldwin?"

> Congressman Baldwin: "Aye."

The voting continued. Some Democratic congressmen surprised abolitionists by voting yes—Lincoln's lobbying had worked. But the count remained close.

> Anti-Amendment Congressman (heatedly): "This is federal tyranny! States have the right to determine their own institutions!"

> Abolitionist Congressman (furiously): "What kind of 'right' allows one man to enslave another? Our nation was founded on the principle that all men are created equal!"

> Moderate Congressman (earnestly): "This war has cost 600,000 lives. If we do not end slavery here and now, those sacrifices will have been for nothing. We must finish this work."

When the final vote was counted, the tension peaked.

> Clerk: "119 ayes, 56 nays. The amendment is passed!"

The House erupted in cheers. Congressmen threw their hats, people in the gallery wept and embraced. Cannons fired salutes outside the Capitol.

> Lincoln (standing, tears in his eyes): "This is the greatest accomplishment of my life. We have finally done it—we have ended our nation's original sin."

> Abolitionist Leader (excited): "Mr. President, your name will be forever linked with freedom. The Declaration of Independence promised that all men are created equal, but not until today have we begun to fulfill that promise."

> Black Spectator (in the gallery): "My children will be born free. They will never know the weight of chains. Thank God, and thank these brave men."

But an elderly abolitionist remained sober.

> Old Abolitionist (seriously): "This is a great victory, but only the first step. There is a long road between freedom on paper and freedom in reality. We have abolished slavery, but we have not yet established equality."
