## Background
In the late 19th century, American farmers faced severe economic crisis. Railroad companies charged exorbitant shipping rates, banks provided high-interest loans, crop prices fell continuously, and deflationary monetary policy increased their debt burden. In 1892, the Populist Party formed in Omaha, issuing the radical Omaha Platform demanding government ownership of railroads and telegraphs, graduated income tax, direct election of senators, and unlimited silver coinage to increase money supply. They believed the gold standard served only Eastern bankers and industrialists, while free silver would let farmers repay debts with depreciated currency. By 1896, this farmers' revolt reached its climax.

## Process
In July 1896, the Democratic National Convention convened in Chicago. William Jennings Bryan, age 36, delivered his famous "Cross of Gold" speech. With religious fervor and poetic language, he defended farmers and workers, attacked the gold standard, and called for free silver coinage. The speech's climax came when he spread his arms wide, mimicking crucifixion, and proclaimed: "You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold!" The hall erupted in frenzy—delegates cheered, wept, and embraced. Bryan won the Democratic nomination and the Populist Party endorsed him. However, in the general election, he lost to Republican William McKinley, who had support from industrialists and urban voters.

## Result
Despite Bryan's defeat, the Populist movement profoundly influenced American politics. Many Omaha Platform proposals—graduated income tax, direct election of senators, greater government intervention in the economy—were gradually adopted during the Progressive Era. The 16th and 17th Amendments, passed in 1913, established income tax and direct election of senators respectively. The Populist Party itself rapidly disintegrated after 1896, but it demonstrated the political mobilization capacity of farmers and the working class, and revealed deep divisions in American society during industrialization: urban vs. rural, East vs. West, creditors vs. debtors. Populism became part of American political tradition and resonates to this day.

**AP Note**: The Populist movement represented farmers' revolt against railroads, banks, and deflation. The free silver vs. gold standard debate reflected debtor vs. creditor conflict. Many Omaha Platform proposals (graduated income tax, direct election of senators) were later adopted during the Progressive Era. Bryan lost to McKinley, but Populist ideas influenced 20th-century reform movements. The movement revealed class and regional divisions in industrializing America.

### Scene: The Cross of Gold Speech

On July 9, 1896, the Chicago Coliseum overflowed with twenty thousand delegates and spectators packed into every corner. William Jennings Bryan took the platform, young and handsome, eyes burning with idealistic fire.

> Bryan (passionately): "We fight for the toiling masses, not the idle holders of capital! We fight for those who labor in mines, toil in fields, and work hard in cities!"

The crowd erupted in thunderous applause. Bryan's voice echoed through the hall, clearly audible even in the last row. He needed no microphone—lung power and passion alone conquered the audience.

> Bryan (voice rising): "You come to us and tell us that the gold standard is good. But I say this so-called gold standard only benefits Wall Street bankers! It makes farmers' debts heavier and heavier, it starves our children!"

> Farmer Delegate (shouting): "That's right! We want free silver!"

Bryan pressed forward, his speech reaching its climax. He spread his arms wide, body leaning back as if nailed to an invisible cross, voice like thunder: "If they dare to come out and defend the gold standard, we will answer their demand and give them a clear definition! You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns—" he paused, letting each word strike listeners' hearts, "you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold!"

The entire hall descended into madness. Men jumped on chairs waving hats, women wept and waved handkerchiefs, the uproar continued for half an hour. Bryan became the Democratic nominee and a symbol of hope for farmers and the working class. Though he ultimately lost to McKinley and the money of industrial capital, his voice forever changed American political discourse—from that point forward, no politician could ignore the voice of ordinary people.
