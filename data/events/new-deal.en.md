## Background
When Roosevelt took office in 1933, America was in the depths of the Great Depression: unemployment at 25%, thousands of banks failed, millions of families lost their savings and homes, and "Hoovervilles" (homeless encampments) dotted the nation. President Hoover had insisted on laissez-faire policies, believing the market would self-correct. In his inaugural address, Roosevelt declared: "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."

## Process
Roosevelt launched a lightning-fast series of legislation during the "Hundred Days." Three core goals—Relief, Recovery, Reform—known as the "3Rs":

**Relief**: The Emergency Banking Act stabilized the financial system; the Federal Emergency Relief Administration provided direct aid to the unemployed; the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) gave 2.5 million young men jobs in reforestation.

**Recovery**: The National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) regulated wages and hours; the Public Works Administration (PWA) invested in infrastructure construction; the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) raised crop prices through production limits.

**Reform**: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulated the stock market; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured bank deposits (still operating today); the 1935 Social Security Act established old-age and unemployment insurance. The Wagner Act guaranteed workers' right to organize unions.

## Result
The New Deal did not fully end the Great Depression (World War II accomplished that), but it fundamentally transformed the federal government's role—from limited government to welfare state. Social Security, bank deposit insurance, and securities regulation remain cornerstones of American society today. Roosevelt also attempted to expand the Supreme Court through his "court-packing plan" to bypass constitutional challenges to New Deal legislation, but this effort failed. The New Deal Coalition (workers, Southern whites, African Americans, urban immigrants) dominated American politics for decades.

**AP Focus**: The New Deal is a central APUSH topic. Must know: 1) The 3R framework (Relief, Recovery, Reform); 2) Key agencies (CCC, FDIC, SEC, Social Security); 3) Fundamental transformation of federal government role; 4) Court-packing plan failure; 5) Political impact of the New Deal Coalition; 6) Limitations of the New Deal (did not end Depression, excluded some groups).

### Scene: The Hundred Days
> Roosevelt (resolute): "This nation calls for action, and action now. The only thing we have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance."

Cold rain fell at the inauguration. Banks had been closed for three days. By their radios, tens of millions of desperate Americans heard the voice of a man in a wheelchair—they didn't know he used a wheelchair, only that his voice was filled with strength. Within 48 hours, he had closed every bank in the nation for inspection; within a week, the first legislation reached Congress; within a hundred days, 15 major bills had passed. America had never seen government move so fast.
