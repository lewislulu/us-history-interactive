## Background
On January 24, 1848, James Marshall was working at John Sutter's sawmill on the Sacramento River in California when he discovered glittering gold flakes in the water channel. California had just been ceded from Mexico to the United States less than two weeks earlier, and was sparsely populated, mainly by Mexican ranchers and a few American settlers. Marshall tried to keep the discovery secret, but word spread like wildfire.

## Process
In December 1848, President Polk officially confirmed the discovery of gold in California in his State of the Union address, triggering the greatest mass migration in American history. In 1849, approximately 300,000 gold seekers from around the world flooded into California, known as the "Forty-Niners." They came by sea around Cape Horn, across the Isthmus of Panama, or along the dangerous overland trails westward. San Francisco exploded from a small village into a booming city, and tent cities and mining camps sprouted throughout the mountains.

## Result
The Gold Rush completely transformed California and the American West. California's population surge enabled it to achieve statehood as a free state as early as 1850, upsetting the balance between slave and free states and leading to the Compromise of 1850. Massive Chinese labor immigration began, forming the first significant wave of Asian immigration to America. The environment suffered severe destruction, and Native Americans faced large-scale displacement and massacre. Though most prospectors never struck it rich, the Gold Rush promoted construction of the transcontinental railroad, gave birth to a multicultural society, and made California one of America's wealthiest and most dynamic states.

**AP Note**: The California Gold Rush accelerated western expansion and California's rapid statehood as a free state (1850), upsetting the sectional balance and leading to the Compromise of 1850. It triggered massive Chinese immigration, caused environmental destruction and Native American displacement, and formed California's distinctive multicultural society.

### Scene: Gold Discovery

> James Marshall (shocked): "Mr. Sutter, I found this in the water channel... I believe it may be gold! We must keep this secret, or your entire empire will be overrun by gold seekers!"

That morning in January 1848, Marshall trembled with excitement as he cupped several glittering flakes in his hands. John Sutter was both thrilled and worried upon hearing the news, knowing this discovery would change everything. Despite their efforts at secrecy, by May, a San Francisco newspaper owner was waving small bottles filled with gold dust in the streets shouting.

> Newspaper Editor (feverishly): "Gentlemen! Gold has been discovered in California! This is the opportunity of a lifetime! Go west, young man, go west and make your fortune!"
