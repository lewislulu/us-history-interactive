## Background
After Lincoln's election, seven Southern states declared their secession from the Union and formed the Confederacy. Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, remained garrisoned by federal troops.

## Process
At 4:30 AM on April 12, 1861, Confederate forces opened fire on Fort Sumter. The bombardment lasted 34 hours.

## Result
The federal garrison at Fort Sumter was forced to surrender. Lincoln immediately called for 75,000 volunteers, and four more states joined the Confederacy. The American Civil War had officially begun.

### Scene: The First Shot of the Civil War
> Lincoln (sorrowfully): "The tragedy of brother against brother has finally come to pass."

The pre-dawn cannon fire shattered the tranquility of Charleston Harbor. The fire illuminated the entire harbor, and also illuminated the destiny of a nation about to be torn asunder.
