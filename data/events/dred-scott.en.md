## Background
Dred Scott was a slave in Missouri whose owner had taken him to live for many years in the free state of Illinois and the free territory of Wisconsin. Based on this, Scott sued for his freedom, arguing that his residence in free territory made him a free man. After ten years of litigation, the case was appealed to the Supreme Court.

## Process
In March 1857, Chief Justice Roger Taney delivered the most infamous decision in American history on behalf of a 7-2 majority: 1) Black people—whether free or enslaved—were not American citizens and had no right to sue in federal court; 2) Congress had no power to prohibit slavery in the territories—thus the Missouri Compromise of 1820 was unconstitutional and void; 3) Slaves were private property protected by the Fifth Amendment.

## Result
The decision caused an uproar. Northerners saw it as proof of a "slave power conspiracy," and the abolitionist movement became more radical. Lincoln made this decision a central issue in his 1858 senatorial campaign debates. Frederick Douglass denounced the ruling but also said: "The Supreme Court is not the final arbiter—the people are." This decision hastened the coming of the Civil War.

**AP Note**: This is one of the most frequently tested Supreme Court cases in APUSH. Understand the three key rulings and how it invalidated the Missouri Compromise and intensified sectional division. Often compared with Plessy v. Ferguson and Brown v. Board.

### Scene: The Supreme Court Ruling
> Chief Justice Taney (coldly): "The Negro has no rights which the white man is bound to respect."

When Douglass read the decision, he clenched his fists. He wrote: "This court may degrade a race, but it cannot extinguish a race's hunger for freedom." In the North, "the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision" became as detestable a phrase as "slavery" itself.
