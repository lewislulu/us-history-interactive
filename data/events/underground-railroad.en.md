## Background
The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 mandated that Northern states assist in capturing runaway slaves and return them to the South. This outraged abolitionists and actually accelerated the massive expansion of the secret escape network—the Underground Railroad.

## Process
The Underground Railroad was not an actual railroad, but a secret network composed of abolitionists. "Conductors" guided fugitives along safe routes northward, while "stations" were homes and churches that provided refuge. The most famous "conductor," Harriet Tubman, returned to the South 13 times, helping approximately 70 people escape to freedom. Frederick Douglass's home in Rochester also served as an important way station.

## Result
It is estimated that from 1810 to 1860, approximately 100,000 slaves escaped to the North and Canada through the Underground Railroad. This movement intensified North-South tensions and became one of the important factors leading to the Civil War. Tubman was honored as the "Black Moses."

### Scene: Midnight Flight
> Harriet Tubman (in a low voice): "Head north. Follow the North Star. If you hear dogs barking—wade into the river, they can't smell you there."

Under the moonlight, six figures moved silently through the cornfield. The youngest child was only five years old, held tightly in her mother's arms. In the distance, hunting dogs could be heard barking. Tubman drew her pistol: "We move forward. No one turns back."
