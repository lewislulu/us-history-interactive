## Background
In the Gilded Age, wealth was highly concentrated in the hands of a few industrial magnates. Carnegie Steel Company's Homestead plant was the world's largest steel mill. In 1892, when the labor contract expired, management drastically cut wages, and workers decided to strike. Carnegie himself was vacationing in Scotland, leaving matters to his hardline deputy, Henry Frick.

## Process
Frick hired 300 Pinkerton detectives to travel by barge up the Monongahela River to infiltrate the factory. At dawn on July 6, workers discovered the invaders and a fierce battle erupted. Twelve hours of gunfire left 7 workers and 3 detectives dead. The Pennsylvania governor ultimately deployed 8,500 National Guardsmen to suppress the strike.

## Result
The strike was crushed and union power suffered a devastating blow. National public opinion initially sympathized with the workers, but an anarchist's failed assassination attempt on Frick turned public sentiment. Carnegie's reputation plummeted, and he spent the rest of his life dedicated to philanthropy as atonement. Homestead became an epitome of Gilded Age labor-capital conflict.

### Scene: The Steel Mill Battle
> Frick (coldly): "The factory is my private property. Whoever stands in the doorway—remove them."

At four in the morning, the barge slowly docked. Workers on the shore were already prepared for battle—some with hunting rifles, some wielding iron pipes. After the first gunshot, gunsmoke spread across the Monongahela River. Women and children stood on the hillside watching their husbands and fathers exchange fire with uniformed detectives.
