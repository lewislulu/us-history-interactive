## Background
The presidential election of 1800 was the first truly partisan contest in American history. Federalist President John Adams sought reelection, while the Democratic-Republicans nominated Thomas Jefferson for president with Aaron Burr as his running mate. The campaign was exceptionally fierce and filled with vicious attacks: Federalists accused Jefferson of being a dangerous radical and atheist, while Democratic-Republicans denounced Adams as a monarchist. Worse still, the Federalists were internally divided, with Hamilton publicly criticizing Adams and undermining his own party's unity. The entire nation anxiously awaited the election results, uncertain whether the young republic could withstand the test of transferring power.

## Process
When election results came in, a major constitutional flaw emerged: Jefferson and Burr tied in the Electoral College, each receiving 73 votes. Under the rules of the time, the House of Representatives had to decide who would be president. Voting in the House went through 35 ballots, with Federalists—though they had lost the election—controlling the deciding votes. Many Federalists detested Jefferson, but Hamilton made a stunning decision: he actively lobbied Federalist colleagues to support Jefferson over Burr. Hamilton believed that while Jefferson was his political opponent, he at least had principles, whereas Burr was a dangerous and unprincipled opportunist.

## Result
Ultimately, influenced by Hamilton, several Federalist congressmen abstained, allowing Jefferson to win on the 36th ballot. This election became known as the "Revolution of 1800" because it achieved the first peaceful transfer of power between opposing parties in American history—an almost unheard-of feat in the world at that time. In his inaugural address, Jefferson emphasized reconciliation, declaring "We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists." The election also exposed flaws in the Electoral College system, directly leading to the passage of the 12th Amendment in 1804, which required electors to vote separately for president and vice president. Jefferson's victory marked the triumph of limited government and agrarian republicanism, ushering in over two decades of Democratic-Republican rule.

**AP Note**: The "Revolution of 1800" achieved the first peaceful transfer of power between opposing parties in American history, proving the resilience of republican government. The election exposed Electoral College flaws (no separate votes for president and vice president), directly spawning the 12th Amendment. Jefferson's vision of limited government defeated the Federalist advocacy of strong central authority.

### Scene: Hamilton Supports Jefferson
> Hamilton (worried but resolute): "I know every one of Mr. Jefferson's faults—his idealism, his illusions about France, his fear of federal power. But Burr has no principles, only ambition. He would sell anything for power."

In February 1801, the House of Representatives was deadlocked for days. Federalist congressmen gathered in the Capitol, debating whom to support. Hamilton continuously wrote letters to party colleagues, urging them to back Jefferson. Many couldn't understand—why support a man who would destroy everything you've built?

> Federalist Congressman (confused): "Hamilton, Jefferson will dismantle everything you've created! The National Bank, the tariff system, the strong navy—all will be abolished! How can you support him?"

> Hamilton (gravely): "Because Jefferson believes in something, even if I disagree. But Burr believes only in himself. In a republic, I would rather have an honest opponent than an unprincipled ally. Our country cannot afford a man like Burr."

Ultimately, Hamilton's persuasion worked. Several key Federalist congressmen abstained, and Jefferson was elected. Three years later, Burr killed Hamilton in a duel, proving the latter's judgment of him correct.
