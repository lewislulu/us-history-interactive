## Background
After World War II, Berlin was divided into four occupation zones controlled by the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. As the Cold War intensified, Germany formally split in 1949 into West Germany (Federal Republic) and East Germany (Democratic Republic). Though located within East Germany, West Berlin remained under Western Allied control, becoming an island of freedom and democracy in the communist world. From 1949 to 1961, over 3.5 million East Germans (one-fifth of the population) fled to the West through Berlin, many of them well-educated professionals, engineers, and doctors. This brain drain seriously threatened East Germany's economic and political stability.

## Process
In the early hours of August 13, 1961, East German soldiers and workers suddenly laid barbed wire along the East-West Berlin border, cutting off all passages. Thousands of families were separated overnight, many unable to return home. In the following days, the barbed wire was replaced by a concrete wall, standing 12 feet high and topped with broken glass and more wire. The East German government called it the "Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart," but in reality, it was a prison wall to prevent people from escaping. West Berlin became completely surrounded, an island in a communist sea. Soviet leader Khrushchev and newly inaugurated President Kennedy confronted each other over Berlin, and the world feared this might trigger World War III.

## Result
The Berlin Wall became the Cold War's most powerful symbol—the physical embodiment of the Iron Curtain. East German border guards received orders to shoot anyone attempting to cross, and at least 140 people were killed trying to escape to the West. In June 1963, Kennedy visited West Berlin and delivered a famous speech in front of the wall: "Freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect, but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in." He declared in German "Ich bin ein Berliner" (I am a Berliner), greatly boosting West Berlin morale. The Berlin Wall stood for 28 years until its fall on November 9, 1989, marking the end of the Cold War. Its existence reminded the world that the line between freedom and oppression could be as real and brutal as a concrete wall.

**AP Note**: The Berlin Wall was the physical symbol of the Containment Policy and the clearest sign of Cold War division. It demonstrated the oppressive nature of communist regimes—they had to wall their people in. Kennedy's speech became a powerful declaration of Western resolve against Soviet expansion, and Berlin became the focal city of the Cold War.

### Scene: Overnight Construction

> East Berlin mother (in horror): "My God! What are they doing? My daughter is still in the West!"

Sunday, August 13, 1961, 2:00 AM. Berliners were awakened from sleep by the sounds of trucks and bulldozers. When people rushed into the streets, they witnessed an unbelievable sight: East German soldiers were laying barbed wire along the border, digging foundations for concrete posts. People's Army tanks stood ready at street corners.

> East German soldier (to an old man trying to cross the wire): "Step back! The border is closed. Anyone attempting to cross illegally will be arrested!"

> West Berlin man (shouting from the other side): "Hans! Hans! Can you hear me? We'll get you out!"

But the wire grew denser, the soldiers more numerous. By dawn, Berlin had been cut in half. On Bernauer Strasse, an apartment building sat exactly on the border line. Desperate East Berliners jumped from windows onto West Berlin fire nets below while East German police tried to grab them. In the following weeks, construction workers bricked up the building, sealing the windows, turning the apartments into part of the border itself.

Days later, 17-year-old Peter Fechter tried to scale the wall, was shot by East German guards, and fell into the no-man's land, bleeding for an hour before dying while soldiers on both sides failed to rescue him. West Berliners watched helplessly, throwing stones at East German soldiers. The Berlin Wall didn't just divide a city—it divided families, friends, and lovers, becoming the cruelest monument to human separation.

### Scene: Ich bin ein Berliner

> Kennedy (standing on the balcony of West Berlin's City Hall, voice booming): "Two thousand years ago, the proudest boast was 'civis Romanus sum.' Today, in the world of freedom, the proudest boast is 'Ich bin ein Berliner'!"

June 26, 1963—Rudolph Wilde Platz in front of Schöneberg City Hall was packed with 450,000 people, nearly a quarter of West Berlin's population. They had come to see this young American president, the leader who had stood firm against the Soviets during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The air was electric with anticipation and hope.

> Crowd (thunderous applause and cheering): "Kennedy! Kennedy!"

Kennedy had just visited the Berlin Wall, viewing the gray streets of East Berlin and the watchtowers from an observation platform. His speech had been written more cautiously, but after seeing that wall, he decided to deliver a harder message.

> Kennedy (angrily): "There are some who say that communism is the wave of the future. Let them come to Berlin! There are some who say we can work with the communists. Let them come to Berlin!"

> Kennedy (pausing, then in German): "Ich bin ein Berliner!"

The plaza erupted in deafening cheers. People wept, embraced, waved flags. On the eastern side of the Wall, East German citizens hid in their apartments, secretly listening to West German radio, hearing Kennedy's voice and feeling a spark of hope.

> West Berlin Mayor Willy Brandt (whispering to an aide): "Today, we are no longer alone."

Kennedy's speech became one of the Cold War's most iconic moments. He declared to the Soviets: we will not abandon Berlin, we will not abandon freedom. For the next 26 years, the Berlin Wall continued to stand, but that day's speech gave the besieged city hope and dignity. Freedom would ultimately triumph over tyranny, even though that day still seemed far away.
