## Background
In September 1862, General Robert E. Lee led the Army of Northern Virginia in its first invasion of the North, hoping a decisive victory in Maryland would prompt European recognition of the Confederacy and force Lincoln's government to negotiate peace. Britain and France were considering recognizing the Confederacy, especially if the South could win a victory on Northern soil. Union forces under General George McClellan pursued Lee's army, and the two sides met near Sharpsburg, Maryland, at Antietam Creek. Lincoln desperately needed a military victory to issue the Emancipation Proclamation he had already drafted.

## Process
On September 17, 1862, Union and Confederate forces fought the bloodiest single-day battle in American history at Antietam. Fighting lasted from dawn to dusk, with brutal combat at locations like the Cornfield, Dunker Church, and "Bloody Lane." In one day, approximately 23,000 soldiers were killed, wounded, missing, or captured. Though McClellan had numerical superiority and had obtained a copy of Lee's battle plans, he was overly cautious and failed to destroy Lee's army. However, Lee was forced to retreat to Virginia, enough for the Union to claim a tactical victory.

## Result
Though Antietam was only a tactical draw, it had enormous strategic and political significance. Lee's invasion was stopped, causing Britain and France to postpone plans to recognize the Confederacy. Most importantly, the battle gave Lincoln the "victory" he needed to issue the Emancipation Proclamation. Five days later, on September 22, Lincoln announced that as of January 1, 1863, all slaves in rebel states would be free. This transformed the Civil War from a war to restore the Union into a war against slavery, making European intervention politically impossible, as no European power would openly support slavery.

**AP Note**: Antietam was the bloodiest single day in American history with 23,000 casualties. The strategic Union victory gave Lincoln political cover to issue the Emancipation Proclamation and prevented British/French recognition of the Confederacy. It turned the war into a war against slavery, making European intervention politically unfeasible.

### Scene: The Bloodiest Day

The morning fog had not yet lifted when the gunfire became deafening. Union soldiers advanced through the cornfield, met by devastating fire.

> Union Officer (shouting): "Forward! Through the corn! Don't stop!"

> Young Soldier (terrified): "Sir, their fire is too heavy! Our men are dropping like wheat!"

The cornfield became a slaughterhouse. Within hours, control changed hands six times between the two sides.

In the afternoon, the battle shifted to a sunken road, later called "Bloody Lane." Confederate soldiers used this natural trench for defense.

> Confederate Officer (firmly): "Hold this road! Every inch must be paid for in blood!"

Union forces attacked from the flank, trapping Southern troops in the sunken road. Within minutes, the road became a ditch filled with bodies.

By evening, the battlefield was covered with corpses and the groans of the wounded. A Union soldier wrote to his family: "The ground is soaked with blood, and cries echo everywhere. I never imagined hell on earth could be like this."

When the battle ended, both sides were exhausted. Lee realized continuing to fight would be suicide, and retreated to Virginia during the night.

> General Lee (exhausted but resolute): "We survived today, but at a terrible cost. The North will never let us go easily."

In Washington, Lincoln received the battle report. Though McClellan failed to destroy Lee's army, stopping the Southern invasion was enough.

> Lincoln (gravely): "This is the moment I've been waiting for. Now that we have a victory, I can issue the proclamation. This war must become a war for freedom, or it will mean nothing."
