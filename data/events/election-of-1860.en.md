## Background
The 1860 presidential election took place in an atmosphere of extreme tension. The Democratic Party split into Northern and Southern factions over slavery, nominating Douglas and Breckinridge respectively. The newly formed Republican Party nominated Abraham Lincoln on a platform of stopping slavery's expansion into new territories. The Constitutional Union Party nominated Bell, attempting to avoid the slavery issue entirely. Southern leaders openly threatened secession if a candidate opposing slavery's expansion won.

## Process
On November 6, 1860, Lincoln won the election without receiving a single electoral vote from a Southern state, and wasn't even on the ballot in most Southern states. He received only 39.8% of the popular vote but won decisively in the Electoral College. Immediately after the results were announced, South Carolina called a special convention. On December 20, South Carolina voted to secede from the Union. By the time Lincoln was inaugurated in March 1861, six more states (Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas) had followed.

## Result
The 1860 election completely exposed America's sectional divide. Lincoln's victory without any Southern support proved that the North had overwhelming advantages in population and electoral votes. Seven states seceded before Lincoln even took office, forming the Confederate States of America. Outgoing President Buchanan declared secession illegal but also claimed the federal government had no power to stop it. This election extinguished all hopes of peacefully resolving the slavery crisis, making civil war inevitable.

**AP Note**: This was a four-way race (Lincoln, Douglas, Breckinridge, Bell). Lincoln won without receiving a single Southern electoral vote, demonstrating complete sectional breakdown. Seven states seceded before his inauguration, showing the degree of sectional collapse.

### Scene: South Carolina Secession

> South Carolina Delegate (excited): "Gentlemen, the election results are clear—a man openly hostile to our institutions will become president, and he didn't receive a single vote in our state! Is this still our country?"

The Charleston convention hall was electric with emotion. Delegates wore formal attire, but the atmosphere was more like preparation for war than political debate.

> Unionist (pleading): "We should wait and see what Mr. Lincoln will do. He has promised not to interfere with slavery where it exists. Perhaps there is still a chance for peace—"

> Secessionist (interrupting): "Peace? Under the rule of a minority sectional party? The Republicans represent Northern interests, and their goal is to destroy our way of life. Waiting is suicide!"

> Convention President (solemnly): "Then let us vote. Should South Carolina secede from the United States of America?"

The vote was overwhelmingly in favor. The hall erupted in cheers, but some were weeping.

> Old-line Politician (sadly): "What we do today, our grandchildren will curse. We are not declaring independence, we are declaring war."

> Young Delegate (passionately): "Then war it is! Our fathers fought for liberty in 1776, and we will fight for our rights! Long live the South!"

When the news reached Springfield, Lincoln was reading the telegram. He was silent for a long time, then said quietly: "They actually did it. There's no turning back now."
