## Background
During and after World War I, large numbers of African Americans migrated from the South to Northern cities seeking work and escaping Jim Crow oppression, a movement called the "Great Migration." By the 1920s, New York's Harlem neighborhood had become the center of African American culture. Despite still facing segregation and discrimination, Northern Black communities enjoyed relatively more freedom and economic opportunity. In this environment, a generation of talented African American artists, writers, musicians, and intellectuals emerged, determined to use cultural creativity to challenge racial stereotypes and redefine Black identity. Harlem became the epicenter of this cultural explosion.

## Process
Harlem in the 1920s witnessed extraordinary cultural flourishing. Writers like Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, and Zora Neale Hurston created poetry and novels exploring Black experience, pride, and resistance. Alain Locke published "The New Negro" anthology, proclaiming a new, confident African American identity. In music, jazz and blues thrived—musicians like Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and Bessie Smith performed in Harlem nightclubs, attracting both Black and white audiences. Venues like the Cotton Club, though ironically allowing only white patrons (demonstrating racism's persistence), featured Black musicians whose performances conquered all listeners. Visual artists like Aaron Douglas created works fusing African traditions with modernism.

## Result
The Harlem Renaissance profoundly influenced American culture and the Black civil rights movement. It shattered stereotypes of African American cultural "inferiority," proving the talent and creativity of Black artists and intellectuals. The "New Negro" concept—proud, confident, refusing second-class citizenship—laid the intellectual foundation for the later civil rights movement. Jazz became an iconic element of American culture, influencing music worldwide. The 1929 Great Depression ended Harlem's golden age, as economic hardship eliminated much artistic patronage, but the Renaissance's legacy endured. It demonstrated how art and culture could become powerful tools for resisting oppression and building identity, inspiring future generations of African Americans to continue fighting for equality and dignity.

**AP Note**: The Harlem Renaissance was an explosive flourishing of African American culture including literature (Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston), music (jazz and blues), and art. It was closely tied to the Great Migration of Black people from the South to Northern cities. The "New Negro" identity challenged racial stereotypes and expressed pride and resistance. This movement laid cultural and intellectual foundations for the later civil rights movement, demonstrating African American artistic and intellectual achievements.

### Scene: A Harlem Jazz Night

On a summer night in 1925, the "Small's Paradise" nightclub on Harlem's 125th Street overflowed with people. Through swirling smoke, Duke Ellington's band performed on stage, trumpets, saxophones, and drums weaving complex, vibrant melodies. Black and white audience members sat shoulder to shoulder, conquered by music's magic.

> Duke Ellington (smiling at the band): "Alright, gentlemen, let's show them real Harlem style!"

The band exploded into improvisation, rhythm pulsing like a heartbeat. The crowd erupted in cheers and applause. At a small table beside the stage, Langston Hughes wrote poetry on scratch paper, pen moving rapidly in candlelight.

> Langston Hughes (reading his verse): "I, too, sing America. I am the darker brother... Tomorrow, I'll be at the table when company comes. Nobody'll dare say to me, 'Eat in the kitchen'... They'll see how beautiful I am and be ashamed."

> Young Female Writer Nearby (excitedly): "Langston, this is so powerful! You're speaking with poetry what all of us feel—we no longer accept being hidden, being denied. We're here, we're beautiful, we're talented!"

> Hughes (firmly): "That's what Harlem means, Zora. It's not just a place, it's a spirit. We're creating a new Black identity—not what white people allow us to be, but what we choose to be."

The music continued flowing, saxophone solo both plaintive and defiant. A white critic sat in the corner, stunned by the scene before him. He wrote in his notebook: "I came to Harlem seeking the exotic, but I found art—real, profound, American art."

Outside the nightclub, crowds thronged 125th Street. Bookstores overflowed with Black authors' works, galleries displayed modern art incorporating African patterns, poetry readings occurred in apartments. This was an era of creation, when Black artists refused to be defined as "merely voices of their race" and insisted on recognition as complete, complex artists.

Yet beneath the prosperity, contradictions remained. The Cotton Club—one of Harlem's most famous venues—admitted only white patrons, Black musicians performed for white audiences, creating white fantasies of "Black culture." But even in such contradictions, the Harlem Renaissance planted seeds of change that would bloom decades later in the civil rights movement.
