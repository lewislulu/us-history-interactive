## Background

In the late 1870s, America was in the midst of the Second Industrial Revolution. Although electricity had been discovered, a practical electric lighting system remained an unsolved technical challenge. Thomas Edison established the world's first industrial research laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey, determined to crack this problem.

At the time, lighting relied mainly on gas lamps and oil lamps, which were not only dim and dangerous but also produced large amounts of smoke. Early arc lights, while bright, were too harsh and unstable for use in homes and offices. Edison recognized that whoever could invent a practical incandescent light bulb would change the entire world.

## Process

Between 1878 and 1879, Edison and his team conducted thousands of experiments at the Menlo Park laboratory, testing various materials as filaments. They tried countless materials including platinum, carbonized paper, and carbonized thread, but most filaments were either too expensive or burned out quickly.

In October 1879, Edison's team made a breakthrough. They discovered that carbonized bamboo filament could glow in a vacuum bulb for over 1200 hours. The key to this success was finding the right filament material and creating a sufficiently vacuum environment in the bulb to prevent the filament from oxidizing.

On the night of October 21, when that bulb continued glowing at the Menlo Park laboratory, everyone present realized they were witnessing a historic moment. Edison subsequently perfected the entire electric lighting system, including generators, transmission lines, and distribution networks.

## Outcome

The invention of the light bulb fundamentally changed human life. Cities were illuminated at night, factories could operate 24 hours a day, and production efficiency increased dramatically. This invention became one of the iconic achievements of the Second Industrial Revolution, driving urbanization and the formation of modern industrial society.

In 1882, Edison established the world's first commercial power station in New York City, marking the true arrival of the electric age. However, this also sparked the famous "War of Currents"—a fierce competition between Edison's direct current (DC) system and George Westinghouse and Nikola Tesla's alternating current (AC) system. Ultimately, AC won out due to its advantages in long-distance transmission, but Edison's light bulb invention remained the beginning of the modern electrical age.

Edison's success lay not only in technical innovation but also in establishing a systematic industrial research model that influenced technological development throughout the 20th century.

On a late October night in 1879, the Menlo Park laboratory was brightly lit. Edison and his assistants gathered around the workbench, watching the glass bulb containing the carbonized bamboo filament. It had been glowing continuously for over ten hours, its warm light illuminating the anticipation on everyone's faces.

"Sir, it's been twelve hours already," assistant Francis Upton said excitedly. "This is longer than any of our previous attempts!"

Edison stared intently at the bulb, afraid it might go out at any moment. "Don't celebrate too soon. We need to make sure it can last much longer. Record all the data—current, voltage, temperature."

Another assistant, Charles Batchelor, couldn't help but ask, "Thomas, do you think we've really succeeded this time?"

Edison's eyes sparkled with light as he slowly said, "Look how steady and soft this glow is. This is what I've been searching for. If it lasts until morning, we've changed the world."

As the night deepened, the bulb continued to glow. Edison knew they had finally found the answer. This small light would illuminate an entire new era.
