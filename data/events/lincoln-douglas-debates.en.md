## Background
In 1858, the Illinois Senate race became the focus of national attention. Incumbent Senator Stephen Douglas championed "popular sovereignty," arguing each territory should decide slavery for itself. Challenger Abraham Lincoln argued that "a house divided against itself cannot stand"—America must be either all free or all slave. The Kansas-Nebraska Act and Dred Scott decision had brought the slavery question to a boiling point.

## Process
From August to October 1858, Lincoln and Douglas held public debates in seven Illinois cities, each drawing thousands of spectators. At the crucial Freeport debate, Lincoln posed a sharp question: if the Supreme Court in Dred Scott ruled territories couldn't ban slavery, what did popular sovereignty mean? Douglas's response (the Freeport Doctrine) stated that locals could effectively block slavery by refusing to pass laws protecting it. This answer won him Illinois but alienated Southern supporters.

## Result
Though Douglas won the Senate seat, Lincoln became a national figure. His moral argument against slavery—not merely technical "popular sovereignty"—resonated widely in the North. Douglas's Freeport Doctrine enraged Southern Democrats, leading to the Democratic Party split in 1860. These debates paved the way for Lincoln's victory in the 1860 presidential election, ultimately leading to the Civil War.

**AP Note**: The Freeport Doctrine alienated the South from Douglas, fracturing the Democratic Party in 1860. Lincoln's moral argument against slavery spread nationally, making him a national figure and securing him the Republican presidential nomination. The debates embodied the fundamental conflict between popular sovereignty and moral opposition.

### Scene: Freeport Debate

> Lincoln (seriously): "Senator Douglas, I have a question for you. The Supreme Court in Dred Scott ruled that Congress has no power to exclude slavery from the territories. So tell these voters—what is left of popular sovereignty? How can the people exclude what they don't want?"

Thousands of spectators held their breath. This was a trap question—however Douglas answered, he would lose supporters.

> Douglas (confident but careful): "The Supreme Court's ruling is one thing, practical enforcement is another. The people of a territory can lawfully exclude slavery through local regulations—or by not passing regulations protecting slavery. Slavery cannot exist a day anywhere against the will of the local people."

> Lincoln (looking directly at the audience): "Gentlemen, did you hear that? The senator admits that people can defy the Supreme Court by not enforcing its rulings. But I say there is a deeper truth—a house divided against itself cannot stand. This government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. It will become all one thing, or all the other."

> Douglas (heatedly): "Mr. Lincoln wants uniformity—uniformity to the point of negro equality with whites! I believe in white supremacy, I believe in states' rights!"

> Lincoln (calm but firm): "I have never advocated social equality. But I do insist that in the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, the negro is my equal, and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man."
