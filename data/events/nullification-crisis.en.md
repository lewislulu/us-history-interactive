## Background
In 1828, Congress passed high protective tariffs that protected Northern industry but harmed Southern plantation owners—they had to purchase Northern manufactured goods at high prices while facing retaliatory European tariffs on cotton exports. South Carolina Vice President John C. Calhoun advanced the theory of "nullification": a state had the right to declare federal laws null and void within its borders. This was an extreme expression of the "states' rights" principle.

## Process
In 1832, the South Carolina legislature passed an "Ordinance of Nullification," declaring the 1828 and 1832 tariff acts void in the state and threatening secession if the federal government attempted enforcement. President Jackson—though himself a Southerner—was furious. He issued a proclamation: "The Union is indivisible," and asked Congress to authorize the use of force. Simultaneously, he pushed Congress to lower tariffs as a compromise.

## Result
Facing Jackson's firm stance and tariff concessions, South Carolina ultimately withdrew its nullification ordinance (though symbolically "nullified" the Force Bill). The crisis was temporarily resolved, but it established a dangerous precedent: the fundamental conflict between states' rights and federal power. Calhoun's nullification theory evolved 28 years later into the theoretical foundation for secession—the birth of the Confederacy. In his final years, Jackson said: "I have only two regrets—that I didn't shoot Calhoun and that I didn't hang him."

**AP Focus**: The Nullification Crisis is a key event for understanding the states' rights vs. federal power theme and a logical prelude to the Civil War. Common topics: 1) Calhoun's nullification theory; 2) Jackson's federalist position; 3) How it foreshadowed Civil War secession; 4) Evolution of states' rights doctrine.

### Scene: Jackson Confronts Calhoun
> Jackson (glaring): "The next traitor to our Union will be hanged from the first tree—so help me God."

At a banquet, Jackson raised his glass and stared directly at Vice President Calhoun: "Our Federal Union—it must be preserved!" Calhoun's hand trembled, wine spilling over the rim. He replied: "Our Union—next to our liberty most dear." The air in the banquet hall froze. The rupture between President and Vice President occurred over this single toast.
