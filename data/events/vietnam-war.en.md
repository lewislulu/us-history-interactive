## Background
Under the Cold War framework, the United States became deeply entangled in the Vietnam quagmire. The Kennedy administration began sending military advisors, and the Johnson administration used the "Gulf of Tonkin Incident" as justification for full intervention. By 1968, American troops in Vietnam exceeded 500,000. The domestic anti-war movement grew increasingly intense.

## Process
In March 1965, American ground forces officially landed at Da Nang, beginning large-scale combat operations. However, facing the Viet Cong's guerrilla warfare tactics, the American military's technological superiority proved difficult to leverage. During the 1968 Tet Offensive, North Vietnam simultaneously attacked over 100 cities in South Vietnam. Though militarily unsuccessful, it psychologically devastated American public confidence. Television images of the war shocked the American people.

## Result
The Vietnam War ultimately resulted in 58,000 American military deaths and over 1.5 million Vietnamese casualties. In 1973, the United States signed a ceasefire agreement and withdrew, and Saigon fell in 1975. The Vietnam War profoundly divided American society, shook public trust in government, catalyzed the counterculture movement, and is called America's "first lost war."

### Scene: The Tet Offensive
> Walter Cronkite (with sorrow): "If we are truly mired in stalemate—which appears to be the case tonight—then the only reasonable way out is through negotiation."

When America's most trusted news anchor spoke these words on the CBS Evening News, President Johnson turned off the television and said to those around him, "If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost Middle America." One month later, he announced he would not seek reelection.
