## Background
After the Panic of 1893, the Pullman Palace Car Company slashed workers' wages but refused to lower rents and prices in the company town. Workers lived in a "model town" built by George Pullman, where the company owned all housing and stores. After wage cuts, many families struggled to afford food while still paying high rents. In May 1894, desperate workers went on strike, demanding wage restoration or rent reduction. Eugene Debs, leader of the American Railway Union (ARU), decided to support them by calling on railroad workers nationwide to boycott Pullman cars.

## Process
Debs's call quickly gained support. By late June, 250,000 railroad workers across the nation joined the boycott, nearly paralyzing rail traffic. Railroad companies attached mail cars to Pullman cars, then complained to President Grover Cleveland that the strike "obstructed mail delivery." Cleveland, ignoring Illinois Governor John Altgeld's objections, sent federal troops to Chicago. After troops arrived, violent clashes erupted, killing dozens. Federal courts issued an injunction banning the strike, citing violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Debs refused to comply and was jailed for six months for contempt of court.

## Result
The Pullman Strike's failure marked another major setback for late 19th-century labor. The Supreme Court in In re Debs ruled that the federal government could use injunctions to break strikes. Ironically, the Sherman Antitrust Act, intended to break up monopolies, became a weapon against labor. In prison, Debs read socialist literature and emerged as a leader of the American Socialist Party, running for president five times. The strike clearly demonstrated the Gilded Age alliance between government and business, and the vulnerability of the working class against state power.

**AP Note**: The Pullman Strike demonstrated a pattern of federal government intervention on behalf of business interests. The Supreme Court in In re Debs upheld the use of injunctions to break strikes. Ironically, the Sherman Antitrust Act was used against labor rather than monopolies. Debs's imprisonment and subsequent conversion to socialism reflected how radicalized labor leaders turned to more radical ideologies. The event solidified the government-business alliance against labor.

### Scene: Federal Troops vs. Railroad Workers

At the Chicago rail yards, hundreds of workers gathered beside the tracks, preventing trains from operating. In the distance, federal troops marched in neat formation, bayonets gleaming in the sunlight.

> Eugene Debs (firmly): "Brothers, our cause is just! Pullman cuts wages but not rents—this is an insult to human dignity! We must stand firm!"

> Officer (commanding): "By order of the President of the United States, you will immediately cease obstructing interstate commerce and mail delivery! Disperse, or we will take action!"

Workers exchanged glances. Some clenched their fists, others with children stepped back. Debs stood at the front, hands raised high: "We use no violence, but we will not leave! This is our right!"

> Worker (angrily): "We're only asking for a living wage! Why does President Cleveland side with the rich?"

> Another Worker (desperately): "They have guns, what do we have? We have families to feed!"

As night fell, scattered conflicts escalated to bloodshed. Troops fired on the crowd, workers scattered. Days later, the court injunction came down—judges invoked the Sherman Antitrust Act, a law meant to break monopolies, now used as a tool to suppress workers. Debs stood tall in court: "You can imprison me, but you cannot imprison the spirit that fights for justice." Six months behind bars transformed him from union leader to socialist revolutionary, convinced that only fundamental systemic change could achieve workers' liberation.
