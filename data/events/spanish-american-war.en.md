## Background
In the 1890s, the Cuban people's independence movement against Spanish colonial rule aroused widespread American public sympathy. William Randolph Hearst's and Joseph Pulitzer's newspapers used yellow journalism tactics to exaggerate reports of Spanish atrocities and inflame war sentiment. On February 15, 1898, the U.S. battleship Maine mysteriously exploded and sank in Havana Harbor, killing 266 crew members. Despite the cause being unclear, American media immediately blamed Spain, and the slogan "Remember the Maine!" echoed across the nation.

## Process
In April 1898, the United States declared war on Spain, beginning what would be called a "splendid little war." Theodore Roosevelt resigned as Assistant Secretary of the Navy to organize his "Rough Riders" and led a heroic charge up San Juan Hill in Cuba, making him a national hero. Admiral Dewey annihilated the Spanish Pacific Fleet at Manila Bay, while in Santiago de Cuba, American forces destroyed the Spanish Atlantic Fleet. The entire war lasted only four months, with the United States winning by an overwhelming margin.

## Result
Under the Treaty of Paris in December 1898, Spain ceded the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico to the United States, while Cuba gained nominal independence but effectively became an American protectorate. America became an imperial power with overseas colonies overnight, sparking intense domestic debate. Mark Twain and others formed the Anti-Imperialist League, questioning whether America had betrayed its republican ideals. Roosevelt's heroic performance led to his becoming Vice President and then President in 1901. The war marked America's emergence on the world stage and led to the Open Door Policy in China.

**AP Note**: The Spanish-American War demonstrated how yellow journalism could drive foreign policy, shifting America from isolationism to imperialism. The U.S. acquisition of the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico sparked a national debate about empire versus republican ideals. The war propelled Roosevelt to prominence, strengthened American influence in Asia-Pacific, and initiated an era of U.S. expansion in the Caribbean and Pacific.

### Scene: Remember the Maine

> William Hearst (sneering): "You furnish the pictures, and I'll furnish the war. Spanish atrocities must be seen by all of America!"

Hearst's New York Journal and Pulitzer's World competed to publish sensational stories, with illustrations depicting Spanish soldiers abusing Cuban women and children. When news of the Maine explosion arrived, headlines screamed "Spanish Treachery! Remember the Maine, to Hell with Spain!" War fever swept the nation, and even though President McKinley hesitated, pressure from Congress and the public made war inevitable.

> Theodore Roosevelt (passionately): "This is a just war! We fight not only for the Cuban people, but to prove that America is ready to play the role of a great power on the world stage! Charge!"
