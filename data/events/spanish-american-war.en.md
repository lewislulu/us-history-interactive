## Background
The Cuban independence movement aroused American sympathy. In 1898, the U.S. battleship Maine exploded and sank in Havana Harbor.

## Process
America declared war on Spain. Roosevelt led his "Rough Riders" into battle in Cuba. The U.S. Navy destroyed Spanish fleets in the Philippines and Cuba.

## Result
America acquired the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico, becoming a colonial power. This "splendid little war" marked America's emergence on the world stage.
