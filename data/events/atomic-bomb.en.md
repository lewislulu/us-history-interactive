## Background
By spring 1945, World War II in Europe had ended with Nazi Germany's surrender, but the Pacific War continued fiercely. Though Japan's defeat was obvious, the military refused to surrender, implementing a "homeland defense" plan preparing the entire nation to fight to the last person. The U.S. suffered heavy casualties in the Battle of Okinawa—over 200,000 on both sides, including many Japanese civilian suicides. Military estimates predicted that invading the Japanese mainland (Operations Olympic and Coronet) would result in 250,000 to 1 million U.S. casualties, with Japanese casualties possibly reaching several million. Meanwhile, the Manhattan Project under J. Robert Oppenheimer's leadership had nearly completed secret atomic bomb development. On July 16, 1945, the first atomic bomb successfully tested in New Mexico, releasing energy equivalent to 20,000 tons of TNT.

## Process
President Harry Truman—who learned of the Manhattan Project's existence only months earlier after Roosevelt's death—faced an unprecedented decision. His advisors were deeply divided: some military leaders believed continued naval blockade and conventional bombing would force Japan's surrender; some scientists like Leo Szilard advocated a demonstration explosion to warn Japan; but senior military officials and Secretary of State James Byrnes insisted on direct use to force rapid surrender and demonstrate strength to the Soviets in postwar confrontation. Truman decided to use the atomic bomb. At 8:15 AM on August 6, 1945, the B-29 bomber "Enola Gay" dropped the bomb codenamed "Little Boy" over Hiroshima. A flash, a mushroom cloud rose, a city vanished instantly. An estimated 70,000 to 80,000 died immediately. On August 9, the second bomb "Fat Man" was dropped on Nagasaki, killing about 40,000 instantly. Tens of thousands more died in subsequent weeks, months, and years from radiation sickness and burns.

## Result
On August 15, Emperor Hirohito broadcast Japan's surrender; on September 2, the surrender document was formally signed, ending World War II. The atomic bomb's use sparked intense moral and historical debate continuing to this day. Supporters argue it saved hundreds of thousands of American lives and millions of Japanese lives by avoiding a bloody mainland invasion; critics argue Japan was near surrender, the bomb was unnecessary, and question the morality of targeting civilians and whether Truman intended to demonstrate American power to the Soviets ("atomic diplomacy"). Indisputably, the atomic bomb opened the nuclear age, the U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms race became a core feature of the Cold War, and humanity possessed self-destruction capability for the first time. Hiroshima and Nagasaki became eternal symbols of nuclear weapon horror, and survivors' (hibakusha) testimonies remind the world of these weapons' humanitarian cost. This decision remains a focus of debate among historians, moral philosophers, and policymakers.

**AP Note**: Truman's decision to use atomic bombs to avoid massive casualties from invading Japan remains controversial. The Manhattan Project developed the world's first atomic bombs. Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings killed about 200,000, forcing Japan's surrender. This opened the nuclear age and Cold War nuclear arms race. Debate continues over necessity—saving lives vs. moral unacceptability. The bomb was also seen as "atomic diplomacy" demonstrating power to the Soviets.

### Scene: Truman's Decision

July 1945, Potsdam Conference. The White House Oval Office. President Truman sat at his desk with several reports before him—one estimating casualties from invading mainland Japan, another on Manhattan Project progress. Outside, Washington summer sunshine was bright, but the President's expression was heavy.

> Truman (to military advisor): "Tell me the truth, General Marshall. If we invade the Japanese mainland, how many will we lose?"

> General George Marshall (gravely): "Mr. President, based on Okinawa experience, we estimate the first phase, Operation Olympic, alone would cost at least 250,000 U.S. casualties. If we need to attack the Kanto Plain around Tokyo, total casualties could exceed one million. On the Japanese side—military and civilian—possibly millions dead."

Truman's fingers drummed the desk. He remembered his own World War I experience, those young soldiers' faces.

> Truman (painfully): "A million American boys. And millions of Japanese, including civilians. God... but this new bomb—how many will it kill?"

> James Byrnes (Secretary of State, firmly): "Hiroshima has a population of 350,000, mostly civilians. One bomb might immediately kill tens of thousands, more die later from radiation. But Mr. President, this could end the war with one blow. More importantly, this will show the Soviets our strength—they're expanding in Poland and Eastern Europe. We need Stalin to know what we have."

Long silence filled the room. Truman stood, walked to the window, looking at the crowd outside.

> Truman (to himself): "I've been President only months. Roosevelt didn't even tell me this project existed. Now they want me to decide whether to use the most terrible weapon humanity has ever created... if there were another option..."

> Military Advisor (interjecting): "Mr. President, our scientists suggest we could conduct a demonstration explosion on an uninhabited island, invite Japanese observers to warn them."

> Byrnes (countering): "Too risky. If the bomb fails, we lose all deterrence. And we only have two ready bombs, can't waste them. Japanese military diehards won't be scared by warnings—they need to see real destruction."

Two days later, Truman signed the order. On August 6, when the Enola Gay pilot pressed the bomb release, he didn't know he was changing history. A Hiroshima survivor later recalled: "The sky suddenly turned white, brighter than a thousand suns. Then heat wave, then explosion. When I opened my eyes, my city was gone."

On August 9, Truman broadcast from the White House: "Sixteen hours ago, an American airplane dropped one bomb on Hiroshima... more powerful than 20,000 tons of TNT... The force from which the sun draws its power has been loosed against those who brought war to the Far East." His voice was firm, but that night he wrote in his diary: "I have ordered atomic bomb attacks stopped. The thought of wiping out all those children is too horrible."

The war ended, but debate had just begun. Over seventy years later, historians still argue: was this necessary evil to save lives, or unnecessary massacre? There are no simple answers, only the mushroom cloud's shadow, hanging over humanity to this day.
