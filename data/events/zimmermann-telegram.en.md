## Background
By early 1917, World War I had entered its third year. The United States, under President Woodrow Wilson, maintained neutrality, but German unrestricted submarine warfare had repeatedly sunk American merchant ships, killing American citizens. Despite this, isolationist sentiment remained strong domestically—many believed Europe's war was none of America's business. German Foreign Secretary Arthur Zimmermann devised a bold plan: if the U.S. entered the war, recruit Mexico as an ally, promising to help Mexico recover Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, lost in the 1848 Mexican-American War. He sent this proposal by telegram to Mexico, unaware that British intelligence was monitoring German communications.

## Process
On January 16, 1917, British intelligence's Room 40 intercepted and decrypted the telegram. The British faced a dilemma: if they revealed the telegram directly, Germany would know their code was broken and switch to a new one. After careful consideration, Britain decided to give the telegram to the United States but waited weeks before publicizing it to obscure the intelligence source. In late February, the telegram's contents leaked to American media. On March 1, the full text appeared in major American newspapers. Many initially suspected British propaganda, but German Foreign Secretary Zimmermann himself admitted the telegram's authenticity at a press conference, shocking the world.

## Result
The Zimmermann Telegram completely transformed American public opinion. Residents of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona were especially outraged, and isolationist positions rapidly collapsed. President Wilson gained the public support he needed. On April 2, 1917, he addressed Congress requesting a declaration of war against Germany, calling it "a war to make the world safe for democracy." On April 6, Congress passed the war resolution. The Zimmermann Telegram became the immediate trigger for American entry into World War I, along with unrestricted submarine warfare, ending American neutrality. The event also demonstrated the critical role of intelligence warfare in modern conflict.

**AP Note**: The Zimmermann Telegram was the immediate trigger for U.S. entry into WWI, along with unrestricted submarine warfare shifting American public opinion from neutrality to war. Germany's proposal that Mexico reclaim Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona outraged the American public and collapsed isolationist positions. Wilson gained the public support needed for war. This event marked an important turning point from isolationism to internationalism and showed the importance of intelligence warfare in 20th-century conflicts.

### Scene: The Intercepted Telegram

London, British Naval Intelligence's Room 40. Several cryptanalysts gathered around a table, holding intercepted German telegrams and codebooks. Kerosene lamplight flickered on their weary faces—they had worked through the entire night.

> Cryptanalyst (excitedly): "Good God, look at this! Zimmermann is proposing that Mexico attack the United States, promising to help them reclaim Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona!"

> Intelligence Chief (gravely): "This is the opportunity we've been waiting for. But we must be careful—if the Germans know we've broken their code, they'll change it immediately. We need to make this look like it came from another source."

Weeks later, the White House in Washington, D.C. President Wilson sat at his desk holding a copy of the telegram provided by the British. His advisor stood nearby, waiting for the President's reaction.

> Wilson (angrily): "This is a blatant provocation against American sovereignty! The Germans dare to conspire to dismember our nation!"

> Advisor (cautiously): "Mr. President, we need to verify the telegram's authenticity. If we publicize it, we must ensure it's not forged."

On March 1, when the telegram's contents hit the front page of The New York Times, the nation erupted in shock and fury. In Texas, the state legislature convened an emergency session.

> Texas Legislator (furiously): "The Germans want Mexico to take back our land? We won our independence with blood seventy years ago! Now they want to try again?"

> Another Legislator (firmly): "Those calling for neutrality should wake up! This is no longer Europe's war—this is a threat to American soil! We must go to war!"

When news arrived that Zimmermann himself had admitted the telegram's authenticity, the last doubts vanished. Wilson's words in his Congressional address echoed across the nation: "The world must be made safe for democracy." America's isolationist era ended, and the door to European battlefields opened.
