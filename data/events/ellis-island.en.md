## Background
In the late 19th century, European famine, war, and persecution drove millions to embark on the journey to America. The existing immigrant entry station could no longer handle the sharply increasing immigration tide. The federal government decided to build a new immigrant inspection station on Ellis Island in New York Harbor.

## Process
On January 1, 1892, the Ellis Island immigration station officially opened. Annie Moore, a 15-year-old girl from Ireland, became the first immigrant to pass inspection. Each immigrant had to undergo medical examination, mental testing, and legal review—the entire process taking about 3-5 hours. Doctors marked clothing with chalk—"H" for heart disease, "X" for mental abnormality—those marked would undergo further examination or be deported.

## Result
During its 62 years of operation (1892-1954), over 12 million immigrants entered America through Ellis Island. Most came from Italy, Ireland, Poland, and Russia. These immigrants completely transformed America's demographic composition and cultural landscape. Today, over 100 million Americans trace their ancestry through Ellis Island.

### Scene: The First Immigrant
> Annie Moore (nervously): "My name is Annie Moore, from County Cork, Ireland. I've come to find my parents—they arrived here two years ago."

Fifteen-year-old Annie wore an old coat, clutching a crumpled piece of paper—on it was written her parents' address in New York. The inspector handed her a ten-dollar gold coin as a commemoration of being the first to pass through the new immigration station. Outside the window, the Statue of Liberty loomed through the morning mist.
