## Background
Part of Hamilton's financial plan was an excise tax on whiskey to help pay the national debt. However, this tax policy sparked fierce resistance in the frontier regions of western Pennsylvania. For farmers there, whiskey was not just a beverage but a form of currency—they distilled surplus grain into whiskey for easier transport and trade. Federal tax collectors in the region faced threats, beatings, and were even tarred and feathered. By 1794, violence escalated as rebels attacked tax officials' homes, openly challenging federal authority.

## Process
Facing the growing rebellion, President Washington resolved to take decisive action. This was not merely a tax dispute but a fundamental test of federal authority under the new Constitution. In the fall of 1794, Washington personally led a federal army of 13,000 militiamen westward into Pennsylvania—the only time in American history a sitting president has personally commanded troops in the field. Hamilton accompanied the expedition, determined to demonstrate the federal government's ability to enforce its laws. As the massive federal force approached, the rebels quickly dispersed, most fleeing into the mountains or returning to their farms, with no major battle occurring.

## Result
The peaceful suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion was a major victory for the new Constitution. In sharp contrast to the Confederation government's inability to respond during Shays' Rebellion in 1786, the federal government successfully demonstrated its capacity to maintain law and order. Washington later pardoned most participants, showing the new government's balance of clemency and authority. This incident established a crucial principle: the federal government had both the power and ability to enforce tax laws and maintain constitutional order nationwide. At the same time, it deepened tensions between East and West, between the wealthy class and frontier farmers.

**AP Note**: The Whiskey Rebellion was the first major test of federal authority under the new Constitution. It contrasts with Shays' Rebellion under the Articles of Confederation—when the federal government was powerless to respond, that very impotence prompted the Constitutional Convention of 1787. Washington's decisive action established the federal government's power to enforce tax laws and maintain order.

### Scene: Washington Leads the Militia West
> Washington (solemnly): "Gentlemen, we do not go to conquer our citizens, but to uphold the law. If a free government cannot enforce its own laws, how does it differ from tyranny?"

In October 1794, at the assembly ground in Carlisle, 13,000 militiamen from various states stood ready. The 65-year-old President Washington, in military uniform and mounted on horseback, reviewed the troops. This army was larger than those in many Revolutionary War battles, yet their opponents were just frontier farmers. But for Washington, this was a matter of principle, not a contest of strength.

> Hamilton (firmly): "Mr. President, when the rebels see the federal government's determination, they will understand that resistance is futile. Today we defend not just the whiskey tax, but the Constitution itself."

The federal army advanced westward, and wherever they went, rebels scattered. No major battle occurred; only a few ringleaders were arrested. Washington's military action achieved its purpose: victory without battle, establishing the supremacy of federal authority.
