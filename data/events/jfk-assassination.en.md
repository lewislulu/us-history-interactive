## Background
In 1963, President John F. Kennedy was in his third year of his first term. He had just demonstrated firm leadership during the Cuban Missile Crisis and was pushing an ambitious domestic agenda, including civil rights legislation and tax cuts. However, many of his key bills were deadlocked in Congress, particularly due to opposition from conservative Southern Democrats and Republicans. To secure his 1964 reelection, Kennedy decided to visit Texas, a politically crucial state where he faced skepticism. On November 22, the presidential motorcade was scheduled to travel through downtown Dallas to showcase the President and First Lady Jacqueline's charisma to the public.

## Process
At 12:30 PM that day, the President's open-top Lincoln limousine slowly passed through Dealey Plaza. Suddenly, shots rang out. Kennedy was hit and fell into Jacqueline's arms, while Texas Governor Connally was also seriously wounded. The motorcade rushed to Parkland Hospital, but doctors were unable to save him. At 1:00 PM, Kennedy was pronounced dead at age 46. Police quickly arrested suspect Lee Harvey Oswald, a former Marine who had lived in the Soviet Union. Two days later, Oswald was shot and killed at the police station by nightclub owner Jack Ruby, making the truth even more murky.

## Result
On Air Force One, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson took the oath of office beside Jacqueline Kennedy, who still wore her pink suit stained with her husband's blood. Kennedy's assassination shocked the nation as millions of Americans gathered around televisions to mourn their young president, bringing the "Camelot" era to a dramatic end. President Johnson leveraged the national grief to successfully push through Kennedy's stalled legislation, including the 1964 Civil Rights Act and tax cuts. The Warren Commission's official investigation concluded that Oswald acted alone, but conspiracy theories persist to this day. The assassination profoundly impacted American politics, accelerating the civil rights movement while also leading to deeper US involvement in the Vietnam War.

**AP Note**: Kennedy's assassination was one of the most traumatic events of the 1960s, marking America's transition from postwar optimism to a period of social upheaval. Johnson used the national mourning to advance "Great Society" legislation while simultaneously escalating the Vietnam War. The event highlighted the fragility of presidential power and the role of mass media in shaping national memory.

### Scene: Dealey Plaza

> Nellie Connally, wife of Texas Governor (cheerfully): "Mr. President, you can't say Dallas doesn't love you!"

The convertible slowly rounded the corner onto Elm Street. The sun was brilliant, the crowds cheering. President Kennedy waved to both sides, Jacqueline in her pink pillbox hat, smiling. Everything was perfect, exactly the image the campaign wanted—a young, vibrant, beloved First Family.

> Kennedy (smiling): "That is very obvious."

At 12:30, the first shot rang out. The President's hand went to his throat. Seconds later, a second shot struck his head. Governor Connally was hit as well.

> Jacqueline (screaming): "They've killed my husband! Jack, Jack!"

She crawled onto the car's trunk, trying to retrieve scattered fragments, as Secret Service agent Clint Hill leaped onto the vehicle and pushed her back into her seat. The motorcade accelerated toward the hospital. The joy of Dealey Plaza instantly transformed into chaos and horror. America's age of innocence ended forever on that sunny Texas afternoon.

### Scene: Oath on Air Force One

> Federal Judge Sarah Hughes (solemnly): "Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: I, Lyndon Baines Johnson, do solemnly swear..."

The cabin of Air Force One was crowded, but no one spoke. Outside the windows was the tarmac of Love Field; inside, history was changing. Lyndon Johnson stood at the center, his face grave, his left hand on a Catholic missal—found in Kennedy's bedroom.

> Johnson (voice low and steady): "...that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States..."

To his right stood Jacqueline Kennedy. She had refused to change out of her pink Chanel suit, despite the blood of her husband covering it.

> Jacqueline (whispering to an aide): "Let them see what they've done."

Two and a half hours earlier, she had been First Lady, waving in the Dallas sunshine. Now she stood here, witnessing the transfer of power, witnessing the continuation or end of her husband's dreams. Flashbulbs popped, recording this surreal moment.

> Judge Hughes: "So help you God."

> Johnson: "So help me God."

The plane lifted off, carrying the new president, the body of the dead president, and a shocked nation back to Washington. In the casket at the rear of the cabin lay America's hope and innocence. Ahead lay escalation in Vietnam, urban riots, and more assassinations. Camelot was dead, and the turbulent 1960s had only just begun.
