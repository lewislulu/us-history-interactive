## Background
After their defeat in the 1800 election, Federalists knew they would lose executive and legislative power, so they attempted to maintain influence in the judiciary. In the final weeks of President John Adams's term, the Federalist-controlled Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1801, creating many new federal judgeships. Adams hurriedly appointed numerous Federalists to these "Midnight Judges" positions on his last night in office and nominated John Marshall as Chief Justice. However, the Secretary of State failed to deliver all the commissions before the power transfer, including William Marbury's commission as justice of the peace. When Jefferson took office, he ordered his new Secretary of State, James Madison, to withhold these commissions, triggering a constitutional crisis.

## Process
Marbury petitioned the Supreme Court directly for a writ of mandamus to compel Madison to deliver his commission. This case placed Chief Justice Marshall in an extremely delicate political predicament: if he ruled for Marbury, the Jefferson administration might refuse to comply, making the Supreme Court appear weak; if he ruled for Madison, Federalist influence in the judiciary would be further diminished. In February 1803, Marshall delivered a politically brilliant opinion. He first confirmed that Marbury had a right to his commission and that Madison's refusal to deliver it was wrong; but then he declared that Section 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which gave the Supreme Court power to issue writs of mandamus, was unconstitutional, because Article III of the Constitution did not grant the Supreme Court such original jurisdiction.

## Result
Marshall's opinion, while technically ruling against Marbury, ingeniously established judicial review—the power of the Supreme Court to review and declare acts of Congress unconstitutional. This power was not explicitly stated in the Constitution, but Marshall established it through brilliant legal reasoning. This case became the most important Supreme Court decision in American history, fundamentally shaping the position of the judicial branch in the system of checks and balances. Marshall served as Chief Justice for 34 years (1801-1835), and through a series of decisions continuously strengthened federal power and judicial authority, transforming the Supreme Court from a relatively minor institution into a coequal branch of government. Jefferson deeply resented this but was powerless, because Marshall had won supreme power for the judiciary by "losing" a case.

**AP Note**: Marbury v. Madison established judicial review—the power of the Supreme Court to review and declare laws unconstitutional. Though this power is not explicitly stated in the Constitution, it became a cornerstone of the American constitutional system. This is the most important Supreme Court case in American history, demonstrating Chief Justice Marshall's political wisdom and legal genius.

### Scene: Marshall Delivers His Opinion
> Marshall (calm but forceful): "The Constitution is either a superior paramount law, or it is nothing. If it is superior, then legislative acts contrary to it are not law. And it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is."

On February 24, 1803, the Supreme Court chamber was packed. Jefferson's observers sat in the front row, anxiously awaiting the decision. Chief Justice Marshall began reading his opinion of several thousand words, his tone calm but authoritative. The entire opinion was a carefully crafted legal masterpiece: first affirming Marbury's right, then declaring the Court powerless to intervene.

> Marshall (continuing): "Therefore, this Court holds that Section 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which purports to grant this Court power to issue writs of mandamus, exceeds the jurisdiction prescribed by Article III of the Constitution and is therefore unconstitutional and void. Though Mr. Marbury's request is just, this Court lacks authority to grant relief."

When the reading concluded, the courtroom fell silent. Jefferson's supporters initially thought they had won—Marbury wouldn't get his commission. But some astute observers quickly realized that Marshall, through a strategic retreat, had gained something far more important than any commission: the power to declare laws unconstitutional. The true consequences of this decision would only become fully apparent over the coming decades.
