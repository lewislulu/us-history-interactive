## Background
Napoleon decided to sell Louisiana due to the failure of the Haitian Revolution and the need for funds for European warfare.

## Process
Jefferson sent negotiators who originally only intended to purchase the port of New Orleans. Unexpectedly, Napoleon offered the entire Louisiana Territory—828,000 square miles for less than three cents per acre.

## Result
The transaction was completed in 1803, doubling U.S. territory overnight. Jefferson subsequently sent the Lewis and Clark Expedition to explore this unknown continent.
