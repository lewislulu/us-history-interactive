## Background
In 1803, Napoleon was triumphant on European battlefields but faced setbacks in the Caribbean—the Haitian Revolution shattered his New World empire dreams. Meanwhile, he needed vast funds to prepare for war against Britain. U.S. President Thomas Jefferson had long worried that French control of New Orleans threatened western farmers' trade routes, so he sent James Monroe and Robert Livingston to Paris to attempt purchasing New Orleans and a strip of West Florida. No one anticipated what would happen next.

## Process
In April 1803, when French Foreign Minister Talleyrand suddenly asked the astonished American envoys, "Would you like to purchase all of Louisiana?" the American negotiators could hardly believe their ears—828,000 square miles, from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains, for less than three cents per acre, a total of $15 million. But this deal plunged Jefferson into a constitutional crisis: as a strict constructionist, he knew the Constitution did not explicitly grant the President power to purchase territory. He privately acknowledged his dilemma in letters but ultimately decided that national interest superseded personal principle. He persuaded Congress to approve the transaction, despite Federalists fiercely attacking him for betraying his constitutional philosophy.

## Result
On December 20, 1803, the American flag was raised in New Orleans. U.S. territory doubled overnight, laying the foundation for becoming a continental power. Jefferson immediately dispatched the Lewis and Clark Expedition to explore this unknown continent, inaugurating the westward expansion movement. The purchase had far-reaching effects: it established a precedent for territorial expansion through peaceful purchase rather than war, while also revealing constitutional interpretation's flexibility—even the strictest constructionist would adopt loose construction when national interests were at stake.

**AP Note**: The Louisiana Purchase is a core AP U.S. History topic embodying several key themes. First, it demonstrates how strict constructionist Jefferson adopted loose construction in practice, a contradiction reflecting the conflict between ideals and reality. Second, the purchase doubled U.S. territory, establishing the foundation for continental expansion and directly triggering the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Third, it sparked constitutional debates about executive power boundaries, an issue running throughout American history. Exams frequently test students' understanding of Jefferson's constitutional stance shift and the purchase's long-term impact on U.S. territorial expansion and national development.

### Scene: Three Cents an Acre
> Foreign Minister Talleyrand (casually): "Gentlemen, would you not want all of Louisiana?"

Livingston and Monroe exchanged glances, hardly believing their ears. They had come to buy a port city and were now being offered half a continent.

> Livingston (stunned): "You mean... the entire Louisiana Territory? From the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains?"

> Monroe (eagerly): "What is the price?"

> Talleyrand (matter-of-factly): "Fifteen million dollars. Less than three cents per acre. My master needs funds to conquer Europe."

Thousands of miles away at Monticello, Jefferson fell into deep thought upon receiving the news. He was an advocate of strict constitutional interpretation, but the Constitution did not authorize the President to purchase territory. Yet the opportunity was fleeting.

> Jefferson (in a letter to a friend): "The Constitution has made no provision for our holding foreign territory... But the future of our nation is more important than my personal principles. I choose to act for the good of the republic and let posterity judge my decision."
