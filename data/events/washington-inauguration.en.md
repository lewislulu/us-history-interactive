## Background
In 1789, the U.S. Constitution had just been ratified, and this newborn republic needed a leader to transform the words on paper into reality. The Electoral College unanimously elected George Washington as the first President—the only unanimous election in American history. From Mount Vernon to New York, crowds lined the roads in celebration, but Washington's heart was filled with trepidation: the world had never seen such an elected republican government, and everything was an unprecedented experiment.

## Process
On April 30, 1789, on the balcony of Federal Hall in New York, Washington wore a brown suit of American manufacture, facing thousands of assembled citizens. New York Chancellor Robert Livingston administered the oath as Washington placed his right hand on an open Bible and his left hand on his chest. His hand trembled slightly, his voice low but clear as he repeated the constitutional oath. According to tradition, he spontaneously added "So help me God" at the end of the oath, a practice that later became customary. After completing the oath, Livingston turned to the crowd and proclaimed: "Long live George Washington, President of the United States!" The square erupted in thunderous cheers.

## Result
Washington's presidency established countless precedents for America: he created the Cabinet system, appointing Jefferson as Secretary of State and Hamilton as Secretary of the Treasury; he insisted on the simple title "Mr. President" rather than monarchical titles; most importantly, he voluntarily stepped down after two terms, setting a model for peaceful transfer of power. These decisions shaped American democratic tradition and proved that a republican government could function without a monarch.

**AP Note**: Washington's inauguration marked the first peaceful transfer of power to an elected executive in modern history. Every precedent Washington set—the Cabinet system, the two-term tradition, the presidential title—became a cornerstone of American political culture. The AP U.S. History exam emphasizes the significance of this event for the republican government experiment and how Washington, through self-restraint and careful decision-making, transformed the Constitution's abstract principles into a functioning government system.

### Scene: The Oath of Office
> Washington (anxious yet solemn): "I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."

His hand on the Bible trembled slightly as thousands of eyes witnessed this historic moment. After completing the oath, he paused and quietly added a phrase.

> Washington (reverently): "So help me God."

> Chancellor Livingston (raising Washington's hand, proclaiming to the crowd): "Long live George Washington, President of the United States!"

Thunderous cheers erupted from the square, church bells rang in unison, and thirteen cannon salutes roared. America's first President was born, and a new era had begun.
