## Background
In 1789, Washington was unanimously elected as the first President of the United States, the only time in American history this has occurred.

## Process
On April 30, Washington took the oath of office on the balcony of Federal Hall in New York. He placed one hand on the Bible and solemnly swore the oath.

## Result
Washington established precedents for the presidency: forming a Cabinet, establishing diplomatic protocols, and stepping down after two terms. Each of his decisions set standards for posterity.
