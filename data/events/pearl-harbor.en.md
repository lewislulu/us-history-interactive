## Background
In 1941, Japan's expansionist ambitions in the Pacific were growing unchecked. The United States imposed an oil embargo on Japan. Japan decided to strike first.

## Process
On the morning of December 7, 353 aircraft from the Japanese navy attacked the U.S. military base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in two waves. Eight U.S. battleships were sunk or severely damaged, with over 2,400 casualties.

## Result
The next day, Roosevelt delivered his "Day of Infamy" speech, and Congress voted 388 to 1 to declare war on Japan. The United States fully entered World War II, becoming the "Arsenal of Democracy."

### Scene: Day of Infamy
> Roosevelt (resolute): "Yesterday, December 7, 1941—a date which will live in infamy—the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan."

Roosevelt stood at the Congressional podium leaning on his cane, his voice low and firm. Radio broadcast his words across the nation, with tens of millions of Americans gathered by their radios.
