## Background
By the second year of the Civil War, Lincoln decided to elevate the war's objective from "preserving the Union" to "liberating slaves" in order to gain the moral high ground and prevent European powers from recognizing the Confederacy.

## Process
After the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam in September 1862, Lincoln issued a preliminary proclamation. On January 1, 1863, the formal Emancipation Proclamation took effect.

## Result
The proclamation declared slaves in Confederate-controlled territory "forever free." Subsequently, about 180,000 Black men joined the Union Army. This proclamation transformed the Civil War into a war of liberation.

### Scene: Signing the Proclamation
> Lincoln (firmly): "If my name is remembered by posterity for this act, then my life will not have been lived in vain."

Lincoln picked up the pen, his hand trembling slightly. He said: "I have never been more certain that I am doing the right thing than I am at this moment."
