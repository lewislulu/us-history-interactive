## Background
After World War II, the US and Soviet Union transformed from allies into adversaries. The Soviet Union established communist regimes throughout Eastern Europe, and the Iron Curtain descended. In 1947, Britain, facing economic crisis, could no longer support Greece and Turkey against communist insurgencies and transferred this responsibility to the United States. Diplomat George Kennan proposed the "containment" strategy in his "Long Telegram"—not seeking to overthrow the Soviet Union, but preventing the further expansion of communism.

## Process
On March 12, 1947, Truman delivered a speech to Congress, declaring that the United States would "support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures." This was the "Truman Doctrine"—the first time America committed to global military and economic assistance during peacetime. That June, Secretary of State Marshall proposed the "European Recovery Program" (Marshall Plan), providing over $13 billion in economic aid to 16 Western European nations to assist post-war reconstruction.

## Result
The Truman Doctrine established "containment" as the core strategy of America's Cold War, with the next 40 years of foreign policy—from the Korean War and Vietnam War to the Reagan era—revolving around this framework. The Marshall Plan is regarded as one of the most successful foreign policies in history: Western Europe's economy rapidly recovered, and communism's appeal in Western Europe sharply declined. The Soviet Union refused to participate and prevented Eastern European countries from accepting aid, thereby solidifying the Cold War camps.

### Scene: Declaration of Containment
> Truman (solemnly): "At the present moment in world history, nearly every nation must choose between alternative ways of life... One way of life is based upon the will of the majority, and is distinguished by free institutions; the other is based upon the will of a minority forcibly imposed upon the majority, and relies upon terror and oppression."

The Congressional chamber fell silent. Republicans and Democrats reached consensus on foreign policy for the first time—a rare moment of bipartisan agreement. Truman knew his speech had bound America to a point of no return: from now on, the expansion of communism anywhere in the world would become America's problem.
