## Background
In June 1950, the North Korean People's Army crossed the 38th parallel and attacked South Korea. The United States intervened militarily under the United Nations banner.

## Process
MacArthur's Inchon Landing reversed the tide of battle, but after Chinese volunteer forces entered the war, the front lines were pushed back near the 38th parallel.

## Result
An armistice was signed in 1953, leaving the peninsula divided to this day. The Korean War has been called "the Forgotten War," with approximately 36,000 U.S. military deaths.
