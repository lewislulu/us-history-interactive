## Background
After World War II, the Korean Peninsula was divided along the 38th parallel, occupied respectively by the Soviet Union and the United States. On June 25, 1950, the North Korean People's Army, supported by the Soviet Union and China, crossed the 38th parallel in a massive attack on South Korea. South Korean forces retreated steadily, and General MacArthur, U.S. Commander in the Far East, urgently appealed to President Truman for help. America viewed this as Soviet-backed communist expansion, a direct challenge to the "containment policy." Truman decided to intervene under United Nations auspices, but without formally declaring war, instead calling it a "police action." This established a precedent for "limited wars" during the Cold War era.

## Process
In September 1950, MacArthur orchestrated the daring Inchon Landing, an amphibious assault behind enemy lines that cut off North Korean supply lines and reversed the tide of war. UN forces rapidly counterattacked, crossing the 38th parallel and advancing toward the Yalu River on the Chinese-Korean border. MacArthur arrogantly proclaimed the war would be over by Christmas. However, when UN forces approached the Chinese border, hundreds of thousands of Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers suddenly crossed the Yalu River, using human wave tactics and night attacks to push UN forces back near the 38th parallel. MacArthur demanded permission to use nuclear weapons against China and publicly criticized Truman's "limited war" policy. In April 1951, Truman relieved MacArthur of command for "failure to give wholehearted support to U.S. and UN policies," sparking a national debate about the principle of civilian control of the military.

## Result
The war bogged down in protracted stalemate, with both sides fighting along the 38th parallel. On July 27, 1953, during President Eisenhower's administration, an armistice was signed, leaving the peninsula divided to this day without a formal peace treaty. The Korean War has been called "the Forgotten War," with approximately 36,000 U.S. military deaths and over 100,000 wounded. This war was the Cold War's first "hot war," establishing the pattern of "limited war." The Truman-MacArthur controversy reinforced the constitutional principle of civilian control of the military. The war prompted the United States to adopt NSC-68, dramatically increasing defense spending and militarizing the "containment policy," laying groundwork for subsequent Cold War conflicts like the Vietnam War.

**AP Note**: The Korean War was the Cold War's first "hot war," marking the shift of U.S. "containment policy" from diplomatic to military action. Truman's intervention as a "police action" rather than formal declaration of war set a precedent for bypassing Congress's war-making power. Truman's dismissal of MacArthur was an important demonstration of the constitutional principle of civilian control of the military. The war led to implementation of NSC-68, dramatically increasing U.S. military budgets and fully militarizing Cold War confrontation. The war ended in stalemate, establishing a pattern for later limited wars like Vietnam.

### Scene: Inchon Landing

> Douglas MacArthur (confidently): "We will land at Inchon. Everyone says it's impossible—the tides are too high, the port too small, the risks too great. But precisely because of this, the enemy will never expect it. I will reverse the entire war with one bold stroke!"

At dawn on September 15, 1950, under MacArthur's command, UN forces launched the largest amphibious assault since World War II. Marines scaled high seawalls and broke through North Korean defenses. This bold tactical success made MacArthur an American war hero, but also made him more arrogant. When Chinese volunteers entered the war, the situation reversed dramatically, and MacArthur began openly challenging Truman's policies.

> Harry Truman (angrily): "General MacArthur has forgotten his duty. In this country, the military obeys civilian leadership. I don't care how famous he is—the President is Commander in Chief, and I am that President!"
