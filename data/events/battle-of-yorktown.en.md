## Background
In 1781, the War of Independence entered its sixth year. Washington joined forces with the French expeditionary army and marched south to besiege General Cornwallis's British forces in Virginia.

## Process
The combined American-French force of 18,000 men surrounded 8,000 British troops at Yorktown. The French navy blockaded Chesapeake Bay, cutting off the British escape route by sea. After three weeks of siege, the British ran out of ammunition and supplies.

## Result
On October 19th, General Cornwallis surrendered with his troops. British military bands reportedly played "The World Turned Upside Down." The victory at Yorktown marked the substantive end of the Revolutionary War.
