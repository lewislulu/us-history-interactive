## Background
The Statue of Liberty was a gift from the French people to the United States, symbolizing their friendship during the American Revolution. Sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi designed the statue of Liberty, while engineer Gustave Eiffel (who later built the Eiffel Tower) designed the internal iron framework.

## Process
After being manufactured in France, the statue was disassembled into 350 pieces packed in 214 crates and shipped across the Atlantic to New York. The pedestal was funded by Americans—when funds ran short, Joseph Pulitzer launched a fundraising campaign in his newspaper, and over 120,000 ordinary citizens donated, most giving less than a dollar. On October 28, 1886, President Grover Cleveland presided over the dedication ceremony.

## Result
The Statue of Liberty became one of America's most famous symbols. Inscribed on the pedestal are Emma Lazarus's words: "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free." During the subsequent waves of immigration, this statue became the first sight for millions of immigrants entering New York Harbor.

### Scene: Dedication Ceremony
> President Cleveland (solemnly): "We will not forget that Liberty has here made her home, nor shall her chosen altar be neglected."

New York Harbor resounded with the horns of ten thousand vessels, and one million people poured into the streets. When the French tricolor covering the statue's face was pulled away, deafening cheers and whistles erupted throughout the city. Yet ironically, women were not permitted to attend this dedication ceremony.
