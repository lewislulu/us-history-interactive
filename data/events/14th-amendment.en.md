## Background
After the Civil War ended, the 13th Amendment abolished slavery, but the legal status of former slaves remained unclear. Southern states quickly passed "Black Codes" that severely restricted Black people's freedom of movement, employment choices, and property rights—essentially reinstating slavery in disguised form. Radical Republicans in Congress were determined to resolve the issue definitively through a constitutional amendment.

## Process
In 1866, Congress passed the 14th Amendment and sent it to the states for ratification. The amendment contained four key provisions: 1) All persons born or naturalized in the United States are citizens (directly overturning Dred Scott v. Sandford); 2) No state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; 3) No state shall deny any person within its jurisdiction equal protection of the laws; 4) Former Confederate officials were barred from federal office. President Andrew Johnson strongly opposed it, but Congress overrode his veto by a two-thirds majority.

## Result
The 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868 and became the most frequently cited amendment in the U.S. Constitution. The "equal protection" and "due process" clauses have served as the legal foundation for nearly every civil rights case over the following 150 years—from racial segregation (Plessy, Brown v. Board) to same-sex marriage (Obergefell). It redefined American citizenship and the relationship between federal and state governments.

**AP Focus**: The 14th Amendment is the most commonly tested constitutional content in APUSH. Must understand: 1) Citizenship Clause; 2) Due Process Clause; 3) Equal Protection Clause. How did it overturn Dred Scott? How did it become the foundation for subsequent civil rights precedents?

### Scene: Defining Citizenship
> Thaddeus Stevens (resolute): "Before God, every person—regardless of color, regardless of origin—is a citizen. If our Constitution cannot accomplish this, then let us rewrite the Constitution."

Frederick Douglass wrote in the newspaper: "This is the Second American Revolution. The first time we declared the principle that all men are created equal; now we have finally written it into law." But he also warned: "Rights on paper still need people to defend them."
