## Background
In January 1776, the colonies had been at war with Britain for nine months, yet many Americans still hoped for reconciliation with the mother country. The Continental Congress was paralyzed by conservative hesitation, and public opinion remained divided. Thomas Paine, an English immigrant who had arrived in America just two years earlier, keenly recognized the need to use plain language to convince ordinary people that independence was not only necessary but morally justified. Encouraged by radicals like Benjamin Franklin, Paine wrote a 47-page pamphlet titled "Common Sense" with incendiary prose, using Enlightenment ideas and republican principles to challenge the legitimacy of hereditary monarchy.

## Process
"Common Sense" was published anonymously in Philadelphia on January 10, 1776, priced at just two shillings so ordinary workers could afford it. Paine used fierce language to denounce King George III as a "royal brute" and argued that monarchy was an absurd and immoral institution. He appealed to common sense rather than legal terminology, writing: "Can an honest man pledge allegiance to a power that can destroy him?" The pamphlet spread like wildfire, read aloud in taverns and circulated in military camps. Within three months, "Common Sense" sold over 120,000 copies (equivalent to millions today), becoming the best-selling publication in North American history.

## Result
"Common Sense" fundamentally transformed American political discourse. It shifted the debate from "Does Parliament have the right to tax us?" to "Is monarchy itself legitimate?" Thousands of previously undecided colonists were persuaded to support independence, and local assemblies began authorizing their delegates to vote for separation from Britain. George Washington praised it for producing "a powerful change in the minds of many men." Six months later, the Declaration of Independence formally proclaimed independence, directly inheriting Paine's republican principles. "Common Sense" demonstrated the power of print in shaping revolution and showed how Enlightenment ideas could transform into mass action.

**AP Note**: "Common Sense" is a key document in AP US History. Exams focus on how Paine used Enlightenment ideas (natural rights, social contract theory, republicanism) to challenge monarchy, and how this pamphlet shifted public opinion from reconciliation to independence. It exemplifies the power of print culture during the Revolution and the expansion of popular political participation.

### Scene: Revolutionary Call in Philadelphia Streets

On a bitterly cold January day in 1776, a printer stood on a wooden crate in the Philadelphia streets, holding aloft a thin pamphlet. Dozens of workers, merchants, and sailors gathered around. Benjamin Franklin, wearing a fur cap, stood at the back of the crowd with a slight smile.

> Printer (reading passionately): "There are two modes of human existence—the state of nature and civil society. But monarchy? It is neither natural nor civil, but an insult to both! How can an honest man pledge loyalty to a power that can destroy him at will?"

Murmurs of agreement rippled through the crowd. A carpenter with calloused hands clenched his fist.

> Carpenter (angrily): "Exactly right! What gives George III the right to rule us? Because his father was king? What kind of nonsense is that?"

The printer continued reading, his voice rising with emotion.

> Printer (with passion): "The birthday of a new world is at hand! We have it in our power to begin the world anew! Let us create a republic—a nation where the people govern themselves!"

Thunderous applause erupted. Franklin nodded and murmured, "Young Thomas Paine has accomplished with one pen what a thousand soldiers could not." In the following weeks, printing presses ran day and night producing "Common Sense," each new copy another step toward independence. By summer, independence had become inevitable.
