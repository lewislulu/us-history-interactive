## Background
After his violent actions in Kansas, John Brown formulated a bolder plan: raid the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia, seize weapons, and spark a massive slave uprising. He believed that once the action began, slaves throughout the South would respond and join. He secretly raised funds and recruited 21 followers—including 5 Black men.

## Process
On the night of October 16, 1859, Brown led his band in a raid on the armory and quickly seized control. However, the anticipated slave uprising never materialized. Local militia surrounded the armory. The next day, Colonel Robert E. Lee arrived with Marines and breached Brown's position in the fire station in just three minutes. Two of Brown's sons were killed in the fighting.

## Result
Brown was convicted of treason and hanged on December 2. As he was led to the gallows, he handed out a note: "I, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood." Northerners viewed him as a martyr; Southerners viewed him as a terrorist. This event convinced the South that the North would use violence to destroy slavery—eighteen months later, the Civil War erupted.

**AP Note**: Brown's action is key to understanding the inevitability of the Civil War. Common questions: Why did North and South evaluate Brown so differently? How did this accelerate division?

### Scene: The Last Stand
> John Brown (calmly): "I have done nothing wrong for the poor and oppressed. If it is necessary, I am willing to exchange my life."

At the moment the firehouse door was battered down, Brown was bandaging a wounded follower. He didn't run, didn't beg for mercy. As soldiers' bayonets pierced his body, he looked at Robert E. Lee across from him—the man who would become the Confederate commander. The gears of destiny meshed at this moment.
