## Background
The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 nearly doubled the size of the United States, but this vast territory remained a mystery to Americans. President Thomas Jefferson, both statesman and scientist, had been planning a transcontinental expedition even before the purchase. He selected his private secretary, Meriwether Lewis, to lead the expedition, and Lewis invited his old friend William Clark to co-command. Jefferson gave them multiple missions: find a water route to the Pacific (the legendary "Northwest Passage"), map the terrain, document flora and fauna, establish relations with Indian tribes, and assert American sovereignty over the land. In May 1804, the Corps of Discovery, consisting of about 45 men, departed from the mouth of the Missouri River, beginning this epic journey.

## Process
The expedition ascended the Missouri River, crossed the Great Plains, traversed the Rocky Mountains, and endured countless hardships. They relied on Sacagawea, a Shoshone guide, whose help secured horses and guidance to successfully cross the treacherous Bitterroot Mountains. Sacagawea traveled with her infant son on her back, and her presence signaled to Indian tribes along the way that this was not a war party. The expedition documented hundreds of unknown plant and animal species, drew accurate maps, and established contact with dozens of Indian tribes. In November 1805, after 18 months of arduous travel, the expedition finally reached the Pacific coast at the mouth of the Columbia River. Although they didn't find the legendary water passage (such a route didn't actually exist), their achievements far exceeded expectations.

## Result
Lewis and Clark returned safely to St. Louis in September 1806, bringing back vast amounts of scientific and geographic information. This expedition had profound impacts on America: it mapped the western terrain in detail, providing invaluable information for later pioneers and settlers; it established American claims to the Oregon Country, laying the foundation for future territorial expansion; it documented the lifestyles and cultures of Indian tribes, though this also foreshadowed the catastrophic changes they would face; it discovered and recorded hundreds of new species, making major contributions to American science. This expedition was the concrete realization of Jefferson's "Empire of Liberty" concept and sparked American imagination about the West and the nascent idea of "Manifest Destiny."

**AP Note**: The Lewis and Clark Expedition was a direct consequence of the Louisiana Purchase, embodying Jefferson's scientific spirit and expansionist vision. The expedition mapped the West, established American claims to Oregon, and documented Indian tribes and natural resources. Sacagawea's crucial role demonstrates the complex position of Native Americans in American westward expansion.

### Scene: Reaching the Pacific
> Clark (excitedly writing in his journal): "Ocean in view! O! the joy!"

On November 7, 1805, after 18 months of arduous travel, the expedition finally reached the mouth of the Columbia River. The men stood on the cliff edge, gazing at the surging Pacific Ocean. For most of them, this was the first time they had seen the ocean in their lives. Sacagawea, carrying her son Little Pomp on her back, stood among the group, staring at the boundless waters. She had traveled from the Shoshone mountain homeland all the way to the edge of the "great water."

> Lewis (solemnly): "We have completed the mission the President entrusted to us. From the Mississippi River to the Pacific, every inch of this land has been recorded in our journals. Now America stretches from one ocean to another."

The expedition established Fort Clatsop nearby to prepare for winter. During the long winter nights, they organized notes, drew maps, and repaired equipment. They all knew the return journey would be equally perilous, but they had proven that crossing the continent was possible. This expedition was not just a geographic discovery but a declaration of a young nation's ambitions: America's future lay in the West, in those vast undeveloped lands. Sacagawea gazed at the Pacific, perhaps longing for her homeland, or perhaps contemplating the future of this new land—a future where her people and white settlers would inevitably clash violently.
