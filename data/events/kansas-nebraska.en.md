## Background
To advance the transcontinental railroad through the Nebraska Territory, Senator Stephen Douglas proposed a bill that would divide the region into two territories—Kansas and Nebraska—and allow local residents to vote on whether to permit slavery through "popular sovereignty." This directly overturned the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which prohibited slavery north of the 36°30′ parallel.

## Process
After the bill passed in May 1854, pro-slavery and anti-slavery settlers flooded into Kansas, each side determined to control the territory's fate through voting. Violence quickly escalated—pro-slavery "border ruffians" from Missouri poured in to cast illegal votes, while anti-slavery Free State settlers armed themselves as well. John Brown killed five pro-slavery settlers at Pottawatomie. Kansas descended into a bloody conflict that became a rehearsal for civil war.

## Result
"Bleeding Kansas" became a national event. The act destroyed the Whig Party and gave birth to the Republican Party—a new political party explicitly opposed to the expansion of slavery. It was against this backdrop that Lincoln re-entered politics. The bill proved the bankruptcy of "popular sovereignty"—when the stakes were high enough, ballots would turn to bullets.

**AP Focus**: This is a key event for understanding the political collapse of the 1850s. Commonly tested: Why did it overturn the Missouri Compromise? How did it catalyze the Republican Party? How did it prove the failure of compromise?

### Scene: Bleeding Kansas
> John Brown (fanatical): "I have sworn before God—the evil of slavery must be washed clean with blood. No reconciliation, no compromise."

On a May night, Brown brought his four sons and several knives. In the cabins along Pottawatomie Creek, the pro-slavery settlers did not yet know death was approaching. This was not political debate—this was war.
