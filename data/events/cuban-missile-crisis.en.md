## Background
In October 1962, U.S. reconnaissance aircraft discovered Soviet nuclear missiles being deployed in Cuba, capable of striking most American cities within minutes.

## Process
Kennedy announced a naval blockade of Cuba. Both American and Soviet nuclear arsenals went to highest alert status, with the world standing at the brink of nuclear war. The standoff lasted thirteen days.

## Result
Khrushchev agreed to withdraw the missiles. The U.S. secretly promised not to invade Cuba and to withdraw missiles from Turkey. Humanity's thirteen closest days to nuclear annihilation thus ended.

### Scene: Thirteen Days of Confrontation
> Kennedy (calmly): "In the nuclear age, when superpowers face a choice between humiliating retreat and nuclear war in defending their vital interests—that shows our imagination is too impoverished."

In the White House Situation Room, generals advocated for airstrikes. Kennedy resisted the pressure and chose naval blockade instead. Every hour could have been humanity's last.
