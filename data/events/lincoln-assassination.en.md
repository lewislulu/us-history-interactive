## Background
On April 9, 1865, General Lee surrendered, effectively ending the Civil War. Washington was immersed in the joy of victory.

## Process
On the evening of April 14, Lincoln and his wife went to Ford's Theatre to watch a comedy. Actor John Wilkes Booth slipped into the presidential box and shot Lincoln in the back of the head.

## Result
Lincoln died the following morning. Secretary of War Stanton said, "Now he belongs to the ages." Booth was killed twelve days later. Lincoln's assassination made the path of Reconstruction even more difficult.

### Scene: Night at Ford's Theatre
> Booth (maniacally): "Thus always to tyrants!"

A gunshot shattered the laughter in the theater. Booth leaped from the box onto the stage, brandishing a dagger and shouting before fleeing into the night. Audience members screamed in chaos, and Mary Lincoln held her husband, wailing inconsolably.
