## Background

After the presidential election of 1824, Andrew Jackson had won the most popular votes and electoral votes, but without a majority, the election was thrown to the House of Representatives. Henry Clay threw his support to John Quincy Adams, who won the presidency and appointed Clay as Secretary of State. Jackson's supporters cried "corrupt bargain" and immediately began preparing for the 1828 election.

This period saw profound changes in American politics. Many states eliminated property requirements for voters, granting suffrage to white men who did not own land. This expansion of voting rights created new political opportunities for candidates like Jackson, who could appeal directly to the "common man" rather than traditional elites.

Jackson positioned himself as a representative of the western frontier, a self-made man who had risen from poverty, in stark contrast to the patrician Adams. His supporters portrayed him as "the people's president" while depicting Adams as an out-of-touch aristocrat.

## Process

The 1828 presidential campaign was one of the fiercest and ugliest in American history. Both sides engaged in personal attacks and slander. Jackson's opponents attacked his military career's execution incidents and viciously attacked his wife Rachel, calling her a bigamist (due to technical issues with her previous marriage's divorce proceedings).

The Jackson camp attacked Adams as too aristocratic and wasteful of public funds, even absurdly accusing him of procuring young women for the Czar during his time as ambassador to Russia. Both sides established newspaper networks to spread propaganda, marking the beginning of modern campaign strategies.

A key feature of this election was unprecedented voter mobilization. Jackson's supporters organized rallies, parades, and barbecues, appealing directly to the newly enfranchised masses. Voter turnout surged from about 27% in 1824 to 58% in 1828.

Jackson won decisively, defeating Adams 178 to 83 in the electoral vote and winning approximately 56% of the popular vote. The victory came primarily from the South and West, while Adams dominated only in New England.

## Outcome

Jackson's victory marked a turning point in American politics, ushering in the era of "Jacksonian Democracy." This period was characterized by broader white male political participation, faith in the power of the "common man," and suspicion of federal authority.

Jackson's inauguration symbolically demonstrated this new era. Thousands of ordinary citizens flooded into Washington for the celebration, with many pouring into the White House, standing on furniture, overturning punch bowls, and causing thousands of dollars in damage. While critics saw this as mob rule, supporters viewed it as a demonstration of democratic power.

Jackson introduced the "Spoils System," replacing federal officials on a large scale with his own supporters. He believed this made government more democratic, but critics argued it promoted corruption and cronyism.

The election also solidified the formation of the Second Party System. The division between Jackson's Democratic-Republicans (later simply Democrats) and their opponents the National Republicans (later Whigs) would define American politics for decades to come.

However, Jacksonian Democracy had severe limitations. The expansion of suffrage was limited to white men; women, African Americans, and Native Americans remained excluded. Indeed, the Jackson administration would pursue policies of forced Native American removal, leading to tragedies like the Trail of Tears.

**Scene: peoples-president**

March 4, 1828, Washington, D.C. After Jackson's inauguration, the White House is opened to the public.

**Character:** Andrew Jackson

**Jackson:** "Let them in! This is the people's house, not a king's palace. Today we show the world that in America, sovereignty belongs to the people!"

*Thousands of supporters flood into the White House. Farmers, artisans, frontiersmen—many had never seen such luxury. The crowd pushes to get closer to the new president, standing on expensive furniture, overturning punch bowls.*

**Jackson:** "My friends, your trust is my greatest honor. Those aristocrats say I'm crude, that you're a mob. But I see the true strength of America—not inherited privilege, but you people who work with your hands!"

*Aides watch the chaos with concern, eventually forced to move orange juice barrels to the lawn to draw the crowd out of the White House.*

**Jackson:** (quietly to an aide) "Let the historians judge. Today, the common people of America know they finally have a president who belongs to them. That is true democracy."
