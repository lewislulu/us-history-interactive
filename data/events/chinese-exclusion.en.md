## Background
In the mid-19th century, large numbers of Chinese laborers came to America—first for the Gold Rush, then to build the transcontinental railroad. They undertook the most dangerous work (blasting tunnels through the Sierra Nevada with explosives), yet earned only half the wages of white workers. After the railroad's completion, white workers during economic recession viewed Chinese workers as threats "stealing jobs." Multiple violent anti-Chinese incidents erupted in California, with the rallying cry "The Chinese Must Go."

## Process
On May 6, 1882, President Chester Arthur signed the Chinese Exclusion Act—the first U.S. immigration restriction law targeting a specific ethnic group. The act banned Chinese laborers from entering the country for ten years and prohibited Chinese already in America from naturalization. The act was repeatedly extended and expanded—extended for another ten years in 1892, and made permanent in 1902. Angel Island in San Francisco became a "detention center" for Chinese immigrants, where many were detained for months or even years.

## Result
The Chinese Exclusion Act was not repealed until 1943 (to maintain the World War II alliance with China), but the Chinese immigration quota was set at only 105 people per year. The act traumatized the Chinese American community for decades—with no possibility of family reunification, Chinatowns became isolated bachelor societies. The more far-reaching impact was that it established the precedent of restricting immigration based on race and nationality. The quota acts of the 1920s (restricting Southern and Eastern European immigration) developed along this same path.

**AP Focus**: The Chinese Exclusion Act is key to understanding American nativism. Must know: 1) First immigration restriction law targeting a specific ethnic group; 2) Combination of economic competition and racial prejudice; 3) How it set a precedent for immigration restriction; 4) Connection to 1920s immigration quota laws.

### Scene: Waiting at Angel Island
> A Chinese immigrant (sorrowfully): "The poems carved on these wooden walls speak of endless waiting: 'The nation's laws exclude us Chinese, subjecting us to infinite humiliation.'"

The walls of Angel Island detention center were covered with Chinese poetry—carved with nails or chopsticks by detainees. Some waited two years before being allowed entry; others were deported back to China. An old man pointed toward San Francisco and told his grandson: "That is the Gold Mountain, but the gates of Gold Mountain were not opened for us."
