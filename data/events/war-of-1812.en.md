## Background
Britain impressed American sailors during the Napoleonic Wars while simultaneously blockading American trade, infuriating the United States.

## Process
The United States declared war on Britain in 1812. During the war, British forces burned government buildings in Washington, D.C., including the White House.

## Result
A peace treaty was signed in 1815. Andrew Jackson decisively defeated the British at New Orleans, becoming a national hero. This war solidified American national independence.
