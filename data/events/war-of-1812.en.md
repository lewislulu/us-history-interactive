## Background
Before 1812, Anglo-American relations deteriorated to freezing point due to multiple factors. The British Royal Navy forcibly impressed American sailors on the high seas, claiming they were escaped British subjects; Britain imposed trade blockades seriously damaging American commercial interests; western "War Hawk" congressmen accused Britain of inciting Indian tribes to attack frontier settlements. Young nationalists in Congress, such as Henry Clay and John Calhoun, demanded war to defend national honor. President Madison finally declared war on Britain in June 1812, launching what Americans called the "Second War of Independence."

## Process
Early in the war, American attempts to invade Canada repeatedly failed. In August 1814, British forces attacked Washington, D.C., burning the White House, Capitol, and several government buildings in retaliation for American burning of York, Canada (modern Toronto). First Lady Dolley Madison fled before British arrival, but she insisted on taking Gilbert Stuart's portrait of George Washington, refusing to let this national symbol fall into enemy hands. British forces then turned to Baltimore, heavily bombarding Fort McHenry, but defenders resisted tenaciously. Young lawyer Francis Scott Key, aboard a British warship, witnessed the night-long bombardment and at dawn saw the Star-Spangled Banner still flying, inspiring him to write what became the national anthem.

## Result
The Treaty of Ghent was signed in 1815, ending the war in a stalemate, but its impact was profound. Andrew Jackson's crushing defeat of the British at New Orleans (though this battle occurred after the treaty signing due to delayed news) made him a national hero, paving his way to the presidency. The war completely destroyed the Federalist Party (which had discussed secession at the Hartford Convention, viewed as treasonous), leaving Republicans dominant and inaugurating the "Era of Good Feelings." More importantly, the war sparked American nationalism, giving birth to Henry Clay's "American System"—achieving economic independence through protective tariffs for domestic industry, establishing a national bank, and building internal improvements.

**AP Note**: The War of 1812, called the "Second War of Independence," is a crucial AP U.S. History topic. Exams emphasize several key themes: the war ended impressment issues, but more importantly its impact on American domestic politics—the Hartford Convention discredited and soon destroyed the Federalist Party; Andrew Jackson's New Orleans victory made him a national hero; war-sparked nationalism led to the "Era of Good Feelings" and "American System" economic nationalism. Students must understand how the war transformed America's political landscape and how it laid the foundation for 1820s economic and territorial expansion.

### Scene: The White House Burns
> British Officer (coldly ordering): "Burn it. Reduce the American President's mansion to ashes. This is the price for their burning of York."

Flames consumed the White House as thick smoke billowed upward. Hours earlier, Dolley Madison had been frantically packing.

> Dolley Madison (firmly to servants): "I will not leave until you take down that portrait of President Washington. I will not let it fall into British hands! It belongs to the American people."

> Servant (anxiously): "Madam, the British are almost here! The frame is nailed too firmly—we cannot pry it loose!"

> Dolley (decisively): "Then break the frame! Quickly!"

They shattered the frame, rolled up the canvas, and fled with it from the White House about to become an inferno. Miles away, young lawyer Francis Scott Key stood on a British warship's deck, watching British artillery bombard Fort McHenry. All night long, cannon fire illuminated the sky.

> Francis Scott Key (excitedly at dawn): "Look! The flag is still there! After the night's bombardment, our banner still waves!"

He pulled out paper and pen, writing with trembling hands: "O say can you see, by the dawn's early light, what so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming, whose broad stripes and bright stars..." This poem later became the national anthem.
