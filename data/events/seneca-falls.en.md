## Background
In the first half of the 19th century, American women had no voting rights, severely limited property rights, and could not attend college. After being excluded from an anti-slavery convention in London, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott resolved to launch a movement for women's rights.

## Process
On July 19-20, 1848, approximately 300 people gathered at the Wesleyan Chapel in Seneca Falls, New York. The convention issued the "Declaration of Sentiments," modeled on the Declaration of Independence: "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal." Sixty-eight women and 32 men signed the declaration.

## Result
The Seneca Falls Convention marked the beginning of the organized women's rights movement in America. Though ridiculed by newspapers at the time as an "absurd farce," it ignited a 72-year movement that culminated in the 19th Amendment granting women suffrage in 1920.

### Scene: Signing the Declaration of Sentiments
> Elizabeth Cady Stanton (passionately): "The history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward woman, having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over her."

The chapel fell silent for a moment. Several male delegates hesitated, but finally stepped forward to sign their names to the document. Outside, the coachman shook his head—he didn't believe these women could change anything.
