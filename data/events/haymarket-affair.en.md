## Background
In May 1886, Chicago workers organized strikes and rallies to demand an eight-hour workday. During the Gilded Age's industrial peak, workers labored 12 to 16 hours daily for meager wages in hazardous conditions. Labor organizations like the Knights of Labor grew rapidly, alarming capitalists and government officials who viewed them as threats. On the evening of May 4th, thousands gathered at Haymarket Square to protest police violence against strikers from the previous day.

## Process
As the rally neared its end, police arrived and ordered the crowd to disperse. Suddenly, a bomb exploded among the police ranks, killing seven officers. Police immediately opened fire on the crowd, and several civilians died in the chaos. Afterward, eight anarchists were arrested and tried, though no evidence linked them to the bomb. The trial was deeply biased—the jury consisted of businessmen, and the judge openly expressed anti-labor views. Four defendants were hanged, and one committed suicide in prison.

## Result
The Haymarket Affair became a major turning point for American labor, but in a negative direction. Public opinion associated unions with violence and anarchism. The Knights of Labor's membership plummeted from 700,000 to under 100,000. Capitalists used the incident to suppress labor organizations. The more conservative American Federation of Labor (AFL) rose under Samuel Gompers, adopting moderate tactics. The event's shadow hung over American labor for decades until unions regained legitimacy and public support during the New Deal era.

**AP Note**: The Haymarket Affair set back organized labor for decades by associating unions with radicalism and anarchism. It led to the decline of the Knights of Labor and the rise of the more conservative AFL. The event exemplified the intense capital-labor conflict of the Gilded Age and revealed how government and media tended to side with business interests against workers.

### Scene: Explosion and Chaos in Chicago

Night fell over Haymarket Square as kerosene lamps illuminated thousands of weary, angry faces. A speaker's voice echoed above the crowd: "We demand eight hours for work, eight hours for rest, eight hours for what we will!" Workers raised their fists and cheered.

> Police Captain (coldly): "In the name of the law, I command you to disperse immediately!"

> Labor Leader (angrily): "This is a peaceful assembly! We have the right to be here!"

Suddenly, an arc cut through the night sky—a bomb landed among the police ranks. The explosion's flash lit up the entire square, followed by a deafening roar. Officers fell, blood staining the cobblestones. The surviving police, panicked, opened fire on the crowd. Gunshots, screams, and the sound of running feet merged into chaos.

> Worker (terrified): "They're killing us! Run!"

> Policeman (hysterically): "It's those anarchists! Get them!"

When the smoke cleared, the dead and wounded lay scattered across the square. That night, the labor movement's dreams spilled onto Chicago's streets alongside blood. In the trial that followed, eight anarchists became scapegoats, though no evidence ever proved they threw the bomb. In court, the prosecutor declared: "Anarchism itself is on trial!" Four men went to the gallows, and American labor entered a long winter.
