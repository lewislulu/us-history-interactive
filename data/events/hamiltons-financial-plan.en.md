## Background
When the new Constitution took effect in 1789, the United States faced a severe financial crisis. The federal government and individual states had accumulated massive debts during the Revolutionary War, and national credit was in jeopardy. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton believed that only by establishing a sound financial system could the survival and prosperity of the new republic be assured. His vision was to transform America into a powerful commercial nation, which required stable currency, reliable credit, and adequate tax revenue.

## Process
In 1790, Hamilton submitted a series of bold financial proposals to Congress: federal assumption of state war debts, establishment of a national Bank of the United States, and imposition of excise taxes (especially on whiskey). These proposals sparked fierce political debate, as southern states (particularly Virginia) had already paid off most of their debts and opposed paying for northern states' obligations. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison strongly objected, arguing this violated strict construction of the Constitution. Through Jefferson's mediation in the famous "Dinner Table Bargain," Hamilton gained southern support for the assumption plan in exchange for placing the new capital on the Potomac River.

## Result
Hamilton's financial plan ultimately passed, laying the foundation for the American federal financial system. The establishment of the national bank and consolidation of debts greatly enhanced American credit and attracted foreign investment. However, these policies also deepened political divisions, forming two major political camps: Hamilton's Federalists, who advocated strong central government and loose construction of the Constitution, and Jefferson and Madison's Democratic-Republicans, who championed states' rights and strict construction. This marked the birth of America's first party system and set the tone for political struggles for decades to come.

**AP Note**: The three pillars of Hamilton's financial plan (assumption of state debts, National Bank, excise taxes) embodied the fundamental conflict between loose constructionism and strict constructionism. This divide spawned America's first party system, and the opposition between Federalists and Democratic-Republicans would dominate the political landscape of the Early Republic.

### Scene: The Dinner Table Bargain
> Jefferson (mediating): "Gentlemen, we are all patriots. Hamilton, the South needs a concession—the new capital must be built on the Potomac, away from the influence of your northern financiers."

On a June evening in 1790, Jefferson hosted a private dinner at his New York residence. Hamilton and Madison sat at the table, the atmosphere tense. Hamilton's assumption plan was deadlocked in Congress, with southern states adamantly opposed. By flickering candlelight, three Founding Fathers conducted the most famous political deal in American history.

> Hamilton (urgently): "If the federal government cannot pay its debts, our credit will be worthless! I accept your terms, Thomas. The capital can move south, but the nation's finances must be secure."

Madison ultimately agreed to persuade several southern congressmen to change their votes, while Hamilton ensured the capital would move south. This bargain saved Hamilton's financial plan while satisfying southern demands for political power.
