## Background

In the early 20th century, the temperance movement reached its peak in the United States. Driven by religious groups, women's organizations, and Progressive reformers, advocates believed alcohol was the root cause of domestic violence, poverty, and social problems. In January 1919, the Eighteenth Amendment was ratified, prohibiting the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages within the United States. In October 1919, Congress passed the Volstead Act to enforce this prohibition.

## Process

On January 17, 1920, Prohibition officially went into effect. However, the law quickly encountered enforcement difficulties. Illegal bars known as speakeasies sprang up across the nation, and bootlegging became rampant. Organized crime syndicates, such as Al Capone's Chicago gang, reaped enormous profits from illegal brewing and alcohol smuggling. Inadequate enforcement, widespread public disregard for the law, and corruption among police and government officials rendered Prohibition largely ineffective.

Prohibition also deepened cultural divisions in American society: supporters were primarily rural Protestants, while opponents were largely urban immigrant communities. By the late 1920s, a growing number of Americans recognized that Prohibition had not only failed to solve social problems but had spawned more serious crime and corruption.

## Outcome

With the onset of the Great Depression, calls to repeal Prohibition grew louder. People hoped that restoring the legal alcohol industry would create jobs and tax revenue. In 1933, the Twenty-first Amendment was ratified, officially repealing the Eighteenth Amendment and ending Prohibition. This marked the only time in U.S. constitutional history that one amendment completely repealed another.

The legacy of the Prohibition era includes: the growth of organized crime, recognition of the limits of social legislation, and the ongoing tension in American culture between modernity and traditional values.

**Scene: The Speakeasy** (speakeasy)

On a night in 1925, in a hidden speakeasy somewhere in New York City, a jazz band is playing. Patrons converse in hushed tones under dim lights, occasionally glancing nervously toward the door.

**Bartender**: "Tonight's 'special drink' just arrived—good stuff from Canada."

**Patron A** (nervously): "Are you sure this place is safe? The one on Fifth Avenue got raided last week."

**Bartender** (lowering his voice): "Don't worry, we've 'taken care of' the police station. And we've got lookouts at the door."

Suddenly, there's a knock at the door—three short, one long. Everyone breathes a sigh of relief.

**Patron B**: "This damn law! Having to sneak around just to have a drink in your own country."

**Singer** (stepping onto the small stage): "Ladies and gentlemen, don't let Prohibition ruin our evening. Come on, let's toast to freedom!"

The jazz music swells again as people raise their glasses, celebrating this fleeting moment of joy.
