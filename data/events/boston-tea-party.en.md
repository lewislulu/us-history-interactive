## Background
In 1773, the British Parliament passed the Tea Act, granting the East India Company a monopoly on tea sales in North America. Colonial anger exploded—the cry of "No taxation without representation" echoed throughout the Thirteen Colonies.

## Process
On the night of December 16th, members of the Boston "Sons of Liberty" disguised themselves as Indians, boarded three British merchant ships docked in Boston Harbor, and dumped 342 chests of tea into the sea. The entire action lasted three hours and proceeded in orderly fashion.

## Result
Parliament erupted in fury and passed the "Intolerable Acts" to punish Massachusetts. But this only sparked broader resistance. The colonies united to convene the Continental Congress, officially launching the independence movement.

### Scene: Dumping the Tea
> Samuel Adams (passionately): "Tonight, Boston Harbor becomes one giant teapot!"

Under the moonlight, dozens of colonists disguised as Mohawks silently boarded the merchant ships. They methodically pried open chest after chest of tea, dumping them into the frigid seawater.

> Onlooker (in awe): "Look—the entire harbor is perfumed with tea."
