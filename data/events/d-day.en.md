## Background
In 1944, the Allies planned a landing in northern France to open a second front in Europe. Eisenhower was appointed Supreme Commander.

## Process
At dawn on June 6th, 150,000 Allied troops crossed the English Channel and launched landings on five beaches in Normandy. Omaha Beach suffered the heaviest casualties, but the soldiers advanced wave after wave onto the shore.

## Result
D-Day was successful, and the Allies established a beachhead. Subsequently, Allied forces pushed inland, liberating Paris in August and forcing Germany's surrender in May of the following year.

### Scene: Omaha Beach
> Eisenhower (resolute): "Okay, we'll go."

The moment the landing craft dropped its ramp, dense machine gun fire swept across. Soldiers jumped into waist-deep icy water, struggling forward through the hail of bullets. The beach was stained red with blood.
