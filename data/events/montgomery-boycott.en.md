## Background
Montgomery, Alabama's buses enforced racial segregation: front rows reserved for whites, back rows for Blacks, with whites having priority in the middle section. Black passengers accounted for 75% of bus ridership yet had to endure second-class citizen treatment—sometimes paying their fare only to be forced off and re-board through the back door.

## Process
On December 1, 1955, forty-two-year-old Black seamstress Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on her bus ride home from work and was arrested. This was not a random event—Parks was an active NAACP member who had received nonviolent resistance training. The Black community quickly organized: twenty-six-year-old minister Martin Luther King Jr. was elected president of the Montgomery Improvement Association to lead the bus boycott. For 381 days, 40,000 Black residents refused to ride the buses—walking, carpooling, riding bicycles to work. King's home was bombed, but he maintained the principle of nonviolence.

## Result
In November 1956, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Montgomery's bus segregation unconstitutional. On December 21, King and a white minister sat together in the front row of a bus. This movement demonstrated the power of nonviolent direct action, and Martin Luther King Jr. became famous overnight as the leader of the civil rights movement. It established a pattern of resistance—economic boycott combined with legal action—that would be replicated by civil rights movements across the nation.

**AP Focus**: The Montgomery Boycott is the turning point when the civil rights movement shifted from legal litigation to mass movement. Essential topics: 1) Rosa Parks' action was organized, not spontaneous; 2) The origins of MLK's nonviolent philosophy; 3) Economic boycott as a resistance strategy; 4) The significance of the 381-day perseverance.

### Scene: Rosa Parks' Arrest
> Rosa Parks (calmly): "People always say that I didn't give up my seat because I was tired. That isn't true. The only thing I was tired of was giving in."

Bus driver Blake walked over: "Are you going to stand up, or shall I call the police?" Parks looked at him: "You may do that." As she was taken away, the Black passengers on the bus sat in silence. But that night, telephones throughout the Black community rang all night—a movement that would change America was brewing.
