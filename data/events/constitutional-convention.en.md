## Background
Post-independence America struggled to function under the Articles of Confederation, with states acting independently and the central government virtually powerless. In 1787, state delegates gathered in Philadelphia, ostensibly to amend the Articles of Confederation, but in reality drafted an entirely new constitution.

## Process
Fifty-five delegates debated behind closed doors at Independence Hall in Philadelphia for 116 days. Conflicts raged between large and small states, and between North and South. Eventually, through the "Great Compromise," they established a bicameral legislature with the Senate and House of Representatives.

## Result
On September 17th, thirty-nine delegates signed the Constitution. It became the world's first written constitution and remains in effect to this day.

### Scene: The Great Compromise
> Benjamin Franklin (wisely): "Gentlemen, I confess there are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve. But I am not sure I shall never approve them."

The eighty-one-year-old Franklin rose at the final day's session to persuade hesitant delegates to sign.
