## Background
The Revolutionary War had been raging for a year, but the colonies had not yet formally declared independence. In June 1776, the Continental Congress appointed a five-member committee to draft a declaration of independence, and 33-year-old Jefferson was chosen as the principal author.

## Process
In a rented apartment in Philadelphia, Jefferson spent seventeen days writing this document that would change the world. "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal"—these words became the cornerstone of the American spirit.

## Result
On July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress formally adopted the Declaration of Independence. This day became America's national holiday. The Declaration not only announced the birth of a new nation, but also provided ideological ammunition for democratic movements worldwide.

### Scene: Signing the Declaration
> Benjamin Franklin (with humor): "Gentlemen, we must all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately."

The delegates walked forward one by one to sign their names on the parchment. John Hancock signed with extravagant large letters.

> John Hancock (proudly): "Let the King read my name without spectacles!"
