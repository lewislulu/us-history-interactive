## Background
During World War I, women entered factories and social service positions on a massive scale, proving their capabilities. Women's rights activists picketed day and night in front of the White House, facing arrest and force-feeding, which actually garnered more sympathy. By 1919, President Wilson finally publicly supported the women's suffrage amendment.

## Process
In June 1919, Congress passed the 19th Amendment, but it still required ratification by 36 states to take effect. One state after another voted, with supporters and opponents evenly matched. In August 1920, everything hinged on Tennessee. Before the state legislature voted, 24-year-old legislator Harry Burn received a letter from his mother: "Be a good boy and vote for suffrage." He changed his position, and by a margin of one vote, Tennessee became the crucial 36th state to ratify.

## Result
On August 26, 1920, the 19th Amendment officially took effect. After 72 years of struggle—beginning with the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848—American women finally gained the right to vote. Susan B. Anthony had been dead for 14 years, but her dying words "Failure is impossible" became reality.

### Scene: Tennessee's Deciding Vote
> Harry Burn (nervously): "I know I might lose my political career over this vote. But my mother was right—it's the right thing to do."

The chamber fell silent. When Burn cast his "yes" vote, women in the gallery erupted in deafening cheers. Opponents threw chairs. Burn jumped out of a window to escape furious opposition. Seventy-two years of waiting, ultimately resting on a young man and a letter from his mother.
