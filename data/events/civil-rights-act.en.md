## Background
Despite the Civil War ending nearly a century earlier, the racial segregation system in the American South remained deeply entrenched. Black people were forced to use separate water fountains, restaurants, schools, and bus seats. In 1963, President Kennedy gave a televised address defining civil rights as a "moral issue" for the first time and submitted a civil rights bill to Congress.

## Process
After Kennedy's assassination, President Johnson used the moment of national mourning to forcefully push the bill through. Southern senators launched the longest filibuster in American history—lasting 75 days. Johnson persuaded wavering senators one by one. On July 2, 1964, the bill finally passed the Senate 73-27.

## Result
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discrimination in employment and public accommodations, making it the most important civil rights legislation since Reconstruction. After signing, Johnson told an aide: "We just delivered the South to the Republican Party for a generation." That prediction remains true to this day.

### Scene: The Signing Ceremony
> President Johnson (gravely): "My fellow Americans, today America takes a long step forward toward freedom. But let us remember—laws alone are not enough. We must eliminate the prejudice in our hearts."

The White House East Room was packed. Martin Luther King Jr. stood behind Johnson and received one of the pens the President used to sign the bill. The man who spoke "I have a dream" in Washington a year earlier finally saw his dream written into law.
