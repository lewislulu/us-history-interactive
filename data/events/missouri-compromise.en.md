## Background
With the vast western territory brought by the Louisiana Purchase, the slavery question became America's most acute political conflict. Missouri applied to join the Union as a slave state, threatening to disrupt the delicate balance at the time—11 free states versus 11 slave states.

## Process
After heated congressional debate, Henry Clay brokered a compromise: Missouri would enter as a slave state while Maine would separate from Massachusetts and enter as a free state, maintaining the North-South balance. Additionally, the 36°30′ parallel would serve as a dividing line—future territories in the Louisiana Purchase north of this line would prohibit slavery.

## Result
The Missouri Compromise temporarily calmed the North-South dispute, but Jefferson called it "a fire bell in the night." This compromise line was like a crack, foreshadowing a greater storm forty years later. Old John Adams warned, "This question cannot be resolved."

### Scene: Senate Debate
> Henry Clay (firmly): "I would rather be right in the wrong before my country than wrong in the triumph over her. But today I ask you to compromise—for the survival of the Union."

Northern senators denounced slavery as "the nation's shame," while Southern senators proclaimed "states have the right to determine their own institutions." The hallways filled with cigar smoke and the scent of impending division.
