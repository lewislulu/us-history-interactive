## Background
After the Mexican-American War, the U.S. acquired vast Western territories, and the slavery question erupted again. California's population exploded due to the Gold Rush, and it applied to join the Union as a free state—this would break the Senate's balance of 15 free states versus 15 slave states. The South threatened secession. The aging "Great Compromiser" Henry Clay stepped in to broker a deal one last time.

## Process
The Compromise of 1850 contained five key provisions: 1) California admitted as a free state; 2) New Mexico and Utah territories would decide the slavery question by "popular sovereignty"; 3) Abolition of the slave trade in Washington D.C. (but slavery itself remained legal); 4) Passage of a stricter Fugitive Slave Law—Northerners were required to assist in capturing escaped slaves, with a $1,000 fine for harboring them; 5) Resolution of the Texas-New Mexico border dispute.

## Result
The compromise temporarily avoided disunion, but the Fugitive Slave Law triggered fierce Northern backlash. For the first time, many moderate Northerners were forced to witness the brutality of slavery firsthand—federal marshals capturing fugitive slaves on city streets to return them to the South. This inspired Harriet Beecher Stowe to write "Uncle Tom's Cabin" (1852); Lincoln later called her "the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war." Underground Railroad activity intensified. The compromise bought ten years of time, but allowed tensions to accumulate more deeply.

**AP Focus**: The Compromise of 1850 is a critical link in the "compromise series" (1820→1850→1854). Must know: 1) The five provisions, especially the impact of the Fugitive Slave Law; 2) Introduction of "popular sovereignty" principle; 3) How it delayed but intensified North-South tensions; 4) The cultural impact of "Uncle Tom's Cabin."

### Scene: The Last Compromise
> Henry Clay (weak but resolute): "I implore you, gentlemen—gentlemen from the South and North—to think as patriots, not as partisans. This Union is worth sacrifice from every one of us."

The seventy-three-year-old Clay stood at the Senate podium, ill and frail, speaking for two days straight. He knew this might be his last battle for the Union. Calhoun was too sick to rise and had someone read his opposition statement. Daniel Webster rose to support the compromise, only to be denounced as a traitor by his New England constituents. The twilight of three giants—within two years, all had passed away.
