## Background
World War I ended on November 11, 1918, with approximately 17 million dead. The war's horror convinced President Woodrow Wilson that a new international order must be established to prevent future wars. In January 1918, he delivered his famous "Fourteen Points" speech to Congress, proposing principles including open diplomacy, freedom of the seas, free trade, disarmament, self-determination, and establishment of a League of Nations. Wilson believed only peace based on justice and reason could endure. In January 1919, the Paris Peace Conference convened, and Wilson personally led the American delegation, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to visit Europe. He received a hero's welcome—millions lined the streets cheering.

## Process
At the negotiating table, however, Wilson's idealism encountered harsh reality. French Premier Clemenceau demanded harsh punishment of Germany to prevent future threats to France, while British Prime Minister Lloyd George sought to preserve British Empire interests. Many principles of the "Fourteen Points" were compromised or abandoned. The final Treaty of Versailles imposed severe penalties on Germany: loss of 13% of its territory and all colonies, military limited to 100,000 troops, and most burdensome, 269 billion gold marks (about $33 billion) in war reparations. Wilson's only victory was incorporating the League of Nations Covenant into the treaty. On June 28, 1919, the treaty was signed in Versailles's Hall of Mirrors—the same place where the German Empire was proclaimed in 1871, a humiliation the French carefully designed.

## Result
Wilson returned home with the treaty but faced fierce Senate opposition. Republican leader Henry Cabot Lodge proposed 14 reservations, centered on opposing Article X of the League Covenant—the collective security clause—arguing it would undermine Congress's war-declaring power and American sovereignty. Wilson refused any modifications and launched a national speaking tour to build support for the treaty, but collapsed from a stroke. In March 1920, the Senate ultimately rejected the treaty, and the United States never joined the League of Nations. The Treaty of Versailles's harsh terms sowed seeds of resentment in Germany, setting the stage for Hitler's rise and World War II. Historians believe that if the U.S. had joined the League and pursued more moderate policies, WWII might have been avoided.

**AP Note**: Wilson's Fourteen Points embodied idealist foreign policy, advocating self-determination, open diplomacy, and the League of Nations. At the Paris Peace Conference, Wilson's idealism clashed with European allies' realism. Domestically, Senate debate focused on Article X of the League Covenant (collective security), with Lodge and others fearing it would undermine Congress's war-declaring power. The Senate rejected the treaty, the U.S. never joined the League, and America returned to isolationism. The Treaty of Versailles's harshness is considered a major cause of World War II.

### Scene: Wilson's Idealism vs. Reality

Paris, Palace of Versailles. Enormous crystal chandeliers hung in the Hall of Mirrors, wall mirrors reflecting countless images of arguing politicians. Wilson sat at the negotiating table, haggard but eyes resolute.

> Clemenceau (French Premier, coldly): "President Wilson, your 'Fourteen Points' are idealistic, but we French lost 1.4 million people in this war! Germany must pay, and we must ensure they can never invade France again!"

> Wilson (earnestly): "Premier, revenge will only plant seeds of new war. We should establish a peace based on justice, let the League of Nations maintain world order, not suppress Germany with punishment and humiliation."

> Lloyd George (British PM, pragmatically): "President Wilson, I understand your ideals, but my constituents demand we 'squeeze Germany until the pips squeak.' We cannot let Germany recover strength too quickly."

Wilson's hands clenched. He knew he was losing this battle. Ultimately, he compromised—accepting harsh terms in exchange for the League of Nations.

Months later, Washington Capitol. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Henry Cabot Lodge stood at the podium, holding the treaty text.

> Lodge (sharply): "Colleagues, Article X of the League Covenant requires member states to defend each other's territorial integrity. What does this mean? It means American boys will fight for some place in the Balkans we've never heard of! This infringes on Congress's constitutional power to declare war!"

> Pro-Wilson Senator (passionately): "But Senator Lodge, if we don't join the League, if we return to isolationism, what was the meaning of our wartime sacrifices?"

Wilson himself, bedridden from a stroke, still refused to compromise. He wrote Democratic senators: "Accept the treaty in full or reject it in full—never accept Lodge's reservations!" This stubbornness led to disaster—the treaty was completely rejected.

In his White House sickbed, Wilson whispered to his doctor: "If America joined the League, there would be no future wars." But history proved him wrong twice—America didn't join the League, and twenty years later, a more terrible war erupted.
