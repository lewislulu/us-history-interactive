## Background
After World War II ended, US-Soviet relations rapidly deteriorated as the Cold War began. In 1949, the Soviet Union successfully tested an atomic bomb, and the Chinese Communist Party won the civil war, bringing American fears of communism to a fever pitch. Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy exploited this panic, claiming that communist infiltrators had penetrated every level of the American government.

## Process
In February 1950, McCarthy delivered a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, waving a document and claiming "I have here in my hand a list of 205 names that were made known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the State Department." Though he never substantiated these charges, his attacks in the Cold War climate triggered a nationwide anti-communist hysteria. The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) investigated Hollywood, placing hundreds of actors, writers, and directors on blacklists. Government employees, teachers, and union members were required to sign loyalty oaths or lose their jobs. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed for alleged espionage.

## Result
In 1954, McCarthy turned his attacks on the US Army, triggering the televised Army-McCarthy hearings. During the proceedings, Army counsel Joseph Welch confronted McCarthy: "Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last?" This moment marked the end of the McCarthy era. In December, the Senate voted 67-22 to censure McCarthy. However, the Red Scare left lasting scars on American society: free speech was severely curtailed, thousands saw their careers destroyed, and an entire generation lived in fear and mutual suspicion. This period became a cautionary tale about the fragility of democratic institutions in the face of fear.

**AP Note**: The Second Red Scare exemplified the domestic impact of the Cold War, demonstrating how democratic societies can sacrifice civil liberties under national security anxiety. McCarthyism became synonymous with politically motivated persecution using fear, and its legacy shaped American attitudes toward dissent and political pluralism for decades.

### Scene: The Wheeling Speech

> McCarthy (waving document excitedly): "While I cannot take the time to name all the men in the State Department who have been named as members of the Communist Party, I have here in my hand a list of 205 that were known to the Secretary of State and who nevertheless are still working and shaping the policy of the State Department!"

The evening of February 9, 1950, the Colonnade Room of the McClure Hotel was packed with members of the Republican Women's Club. Senator McCarthy stood at the podium, sweat beading on his forehead, his voice trembling. He knew this moment would change his political career. The world outside was changing—the Soviets had the bomb, China was "lost," and Americans needed an explanation, needed to find enemies within.

> Woman in audience (shocked): "Good heavens! That many traitors in our own government?"

> McCarthy (lowering his voice dramatically): "This is not a case of random bad apples. This is a conspiracy, ladies, a conspiracy protected by Secretary of State Acheson himself. While our boys bleed in Korea, traitors work in Washington offices!"

Thunderous applause. McCarthy smiled. The "list" in his hand was actually a laundry receipt, but no one would check. In an age of fear, the accusation itself was enough.

### Scene: Army-McCarthy Hearings

> Army Counsel Welch (with sadness and anger): "Until this moment, Senator, I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness. Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?"

June 9, 1954—twenty million Americans were glued to their television sets. In the Senate hearing room, the air was electric. McCarthy had just attacked a young lawyer at Welch's firm, implying he was a communist sympathizer. For four years, the Wisconsin Senator had been unstoppable, destroying countless careers, but this time he had gone too far.

> McCarthy (defensively): "I'm just giving the facts..."

> Welch (interrupting, voice dripping with contempt): "If you have the facts, Senator—and if all my requests have failed—then call the FBI tonight! What are you waiting for?"

Applause erupted in the hearing room. McCarthy looked around and for the first time saw unfamiliar expressions in the faces staring back—not fear, but disgust. The witch hunt was over. The television cameras had captured a bully's downfall, and Americans finally saw their "anti-communist hero" for what he truly was: a demagogue who built his power on lies and fear.
