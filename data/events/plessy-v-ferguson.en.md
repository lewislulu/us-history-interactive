## Background
After Reconstruction ended, Southern states passed "Jim Crow laws" enforcing racial segregation in public transportation, schools, restaurants, water fountains, and all public facilities. In 1890, Louisiana passed a law requiring railroads to provide "separate but equal" cars for Black and white passengers. New Orleans' Black community decided to challenge this law.

## Process
In 1892, Homer Plessy, who was one-eighth Black, deliberately sat in a whites-only car and refused to leave; he was arrested. The case reached the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1896, the Court ruled 7-1 that as long as "separate but equal" facilities were provided for both races, segregation did not violate the 14th Amendment. The sole dissenter, Justice John Marshall Harlan, wrote a famous dissent: "Our Constitution is color-blind."

## Result
The "separate but equal" doctrine provided the legal foundation for 58 years of segregation. In practice, "separate" was real, but "equal" never materialized—Black schools were dilapidated, Black facilities far inferior to white ones. This ruling was not overturned until the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education case.

**AP Focus**: One of the most frequently tested Supreme Court cases in APUSH. Must understand: 1) The "separate but equal" doctrine; 2) How it exploited loopholes in the 14th Amendment; 3) The sole dissent's "color-blind Constitution" argument; 4) How it provided legal support for Jim Crow. Often tested in comparison with Brown v. Board.

### Scene: Separate But Equal
> Justice Harlan (furious): "In view of the Constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens. Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens."

Harlan stood alone against seven colleagues. The pen in his hand once belonged to Chief Justice Taney—the very man who had decided the Dred Scott case 39 years earlier. Harlan wrote his dissent with this pen, as if history were correcting an error through him. But correction would take another 58 years.
