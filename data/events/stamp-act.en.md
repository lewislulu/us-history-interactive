## Background
The Seven Years' War (French and Indian War) left Britain heavily in debt. Parliament believed the colonies should share the burden of imperial defense costs, and in 1765 passed the Stamp Act—imposing stamp taxes on all legal documents, newspapers, playing cards, and even dice in the colonies. This was Britain's first direct tax on the colonies (previously only trade duties had been collected).

## Process
Colonists erupted in fury, articulating a principle that would become the revolutionary slogan: "No taxation without representation." The colonies had no seats in Parliament, therefore Parliament had no right to tax them. "Sons of Liberty" organizations emerged everywhere, burning stamps and threatening tax collectors. Representatives from nine colonies convened the "Stamp Act Congress" in New York—the first united colonial action.

## Result
Facing a colonial-wide boycott of British goods, Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in 1766. But simultaneously it passed the Declaratory Act, asserting Parliament's right to legislate for the colonies "in all cases whatsoever." The crisis was temporarily resolved, but colonists learned a crucial lesson: united resistance worked. This crisis planted the seeds of revolution.

**AP Focus**: This is the starting point where colonial discourse moved from "internal taxes" vs. "external taxes" to wholesale questioning of British authority. Understanding the "no taxation without representation" principle is crucial to the entire revolutionary narrative.

### Scene: No Taxation Without Representation
> Patrick Henry (passionately): "Caesar had his Brutus, Charles the First his Cromwell, and George the Third—may profit by their example!"

The Virginia assembly erupted. Someone shouted "Treason!" Henry paused, then continued: "If this be treason, make the most of it." This speech spread through all thirteen colonies, igniting the flames of resistance.
