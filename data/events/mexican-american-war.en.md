## Background
In 1845, the United States annexed the Republic of Texas, infuriating Mexico—which had never recognized Texas independence. A border dispute followed: the U.S. claimed the boundary was at the Rio Grande, while Mexico insisted on the more northern Nueces River. But the deeper cause was the ideology of "Manifest Destiny"—Americans believed they had a God-given mission to extend democracy and civilization across the North American continent. President James K. Polk was an expansionist who coveted California and New Mexico. After Mexico refused to sell these territories, Polk sent General Zachary Taylor's army into the disputed zone, waiting for conflict to erupt.

## Process
In April 1846, Mexican forces attacked an American patrol north of the Rio Grande. Polk seized the opportunity, declaring to Congress that Mexico had "shed American blood on American soil," demanding war. Congress approved the war despite fierce Whig opposition, with young Representative Abraham Lincoln questioning whether Polk was lying. The war proceeded remarkably smoothly: Taylor won victories in the north, Stephen Kearny occupied California, and General Winfield Scott landed at Veracruz and marched all the way to Mexico City. Ironically, many young officers serving in this war—Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee—would become opposing commanders in the Civil War fifteen years later.

## Result
The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed in 1848, forcing Mexico to cede approximately 55% of its territory, including California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and parts of New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming—the "Mexican Cession." The U.S. paid $15 million in compensation, but essentially expanded to the Pacific through military conquest. The war's victory made the United States a transcontinental nation but also planted seeds of civil war: Pennsylvania Representative David Wilmot proposed the "Wilmot Proviso," demanding slavery be prohibited in the newly acquired territories. Though the proposal ultimately failed, it crystallized the North-South divide, leading to the Compromise of 1850 and paving the way for the Civil War a decade later.

**AP Note**: The Mexican-American War is a crucial AP U.S. History topic involving several key themes. First is the ideology of "Manifest Destiny"—the philosophical foundation of American expansionism, with students needing to understand how this concept justified territorial expansion. Second is the slavery controversy triggered by the war: though the Wilmot Proviso failed, it clearly expressed Northern opposition to slavery expansion, making the North-South divide public. Third is the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and the Mexican Cession—acquisition of these territories sparked fierce debates about slavery expansion, leading to the Compromise of 1850 and ultimately becoming one of the Civil War's catalysts. Exams frequently require students to analyze how the war intensified North-South tensions and how expansion transformed America's geographic and political landscape.

### Scene: Manifest Destiny
> President Polk (addressing Congress, righteously indignant): "Mexican forces have crossed the American border and shed American blood on our territory. War exists, and Mexico has initiated it. We have no choice but to defend ourselves!"

The congressional hall thundered with applause, but young Representative Abraham Lincoln sat in the back row, brow furrowed.

> Lincoln (questioning, whispering to a colleague): "Tell me, where exactly is that 'American territory'? Is the President manufacturing a pretext for war?"

Thousands of miles away, on a battlefield outside Mexico City, two young officers fought side by side.

> Captain Grant (to Captain Lee): "This war is unjust. We are seizing land from a weaker nation."

> Captain Lee (thoughtfully): "A soldier's duty is to obey orders, but history will judge us."

Neither knew that fifteen years later, they would become opposing commanders in an even more brutal war.

In 1848, when Mexico was forced to sign the treaty, the U.S. envoy to Mexico spread out a map.

> Mexican Negotiator (bitterly): "You have taken half our country. Future generations will remember this as conquest, not purchase."

> American Negotiator (coldly): "This is Manifest Destiny. The United States is destined to stretch from the Atlantic to the Pacific. This is history's inevitability."

But in Washington, Representative Wilmot rose to speak: "If we turn this land into a breeding ground for slavery, we will win not glory but a curse." His prophecy came true thirteen years later.
