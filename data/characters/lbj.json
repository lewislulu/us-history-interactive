  "bio": "美国第36任总统，美国历史上最矛盾的领导人之一。他以非凡的政治手腕推动通过了《民权法案》和《选举权法》，发起'伟大社会'计划——医疗保险、医疗补助、教育改革和消除贫困。然而越南战争的泥潭吞噬了他的一切成就，反战运动使他无法竞选连任。他创造了福利国家，也创造了'信誉鸿沟'。",
  "bio_en": "Thirty-sixth President whose Great Society programs transformed America. Masterfully pushed through the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare, Medicaid, and federal education funding. His presidency was ultimately consumed by the Vietnam War, leading him not to seek reelection in 1968.",
